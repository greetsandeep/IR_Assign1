itand#8217;s all happneing ,Apr 5 2004 12:00AM,caryn coleman,  , art and education go hand-in-hand. while i worked in the education department at the    museum of contemporary art in chicago i realized that art is education and    contextualizing it for the general public is necessary. part of my job there was to assist in producing audio tours.    these audio tours were contained in wand-like devices that housed audio files of either the curators or exhibiting    artists discussing selected artwork in an exhibition. visitors purchased these audio tours for an additional fee at    the admissions desks and were off to experience a one-person tour at their own pace. a non-perfected system these    types of tours are generally laughed at by the art community but none-the-less have the potentional to be a bridge    the gap between gaining valuable insite and walking away confused.                soon after i left the mca abandoned these tours as the production and equipment cost is quite high and given the    current financial strain on todayand#8217;s art centers they were the first to go in an effort to conserve money. but boy    are things a-changing. now museums not only have the chance to improve on the nature of these tours but can now do it    for a reasonable price. forward-thinking museums in    japan and    france via    macnn have adopted ipods to house mp3s of art folk discussing    exhibitions. since the ipod is inexpensive holds an insane amount of files is painfully simple to use and can    allow museums to easily rotate sound bytes about specific art pieces itand#8217;s almost crazy to think that more museums    are not doing this! united states iand#8217;m talking to you. ,1650,4,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/its-all-happneing/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/its-all-happneing/,,
is apple itand#8217;s own worst enemy? ,Apr 5 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , fellow win blogger pariah made this statement the other day:        actually appleand#8217;s current direction is the biggest proponent for using windows. apple is doing its best to force  everyone to windows by strangling the market for third-party applications developers on the mac.    needless to say some people had some questions about what he was implying and where he was headed saying something  like that so heand#8217;s been kind enough to explain himself in a little more detail. thius editorial makes the arguement that  apple relies strongly on 3rd party software for a number of reasons and if it keeps trying to beat those companies at  their own game itand#8217;s going to lose in the long run. iand#8217;m not certain i agree with this. i think competition is good and  if people only have one option they are stuck with something with no choice. when thereand#8217;s several programs all doing  the same thing people will lean towards who ever is doing that better. if apple can do it better either those other  companies need to step up to the plate or people will start using the apple version. likewise if they are doing such  a great job in the first place they shouldnand#8217;t be worried about someone doing it better.        iand#8217;m all for improvements whichever side them come from. for example people moved away from outlook because  mail.app is a better program but the first e-mail application that stops spam 100% will be the king regardless of  what company makes it or if it plays nicely with ichat. ,1540,0,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/is-apple-its-own-worst-enemy/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/is-apple-its-own-worst-enemy/,,
playfair strips drm from itunes ,Apr 5 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , iand#8217;m going to let this one speek for itself:        when apple opened the itunes  music store they licensed a technology called and#8220;fairplayand#8221; from a company called and#8220;veridiscand#8221;. fairplay is a digital  rights management drm system that limits a users rights on a digital media file that theyand#8217;ve purchased and presumably  downloaded. in the case of appleand#8217;s itunes music store when a user downloads an audio track from itms it is a  and#8220;protected aac audio fileand#8221;. when used as intended these files can only be played through the itunes program itself.  furthermore a particular computer must first be and#8220;authorizedand#8221; to play the given file. fairplay allows up to three  computers and unlimited apple ipods to be authorized to play the file. as drm schemes go fairplay is only moderately  offensive.    so what will playfair do for you? the playfair program is quite simple. it takes one of the itms protected aac  audio files decodes it using a key obtained from your ipod or microsoft windows system and then writes the new  decoded version to disk as a regular aac audio file. it then optionally copies the metadata tags that describe the  song including the cover art to the new file.    i just got my first taste of itunes drm the other day when i coppied some songs i bought from one of my laptops to  my desktop imac and then onto my other laptop and started getting some static. iand#8217;m planning of retiring my 15and#8221; g4  tibook sometime this year and i know that the new machine i get is only going to complicate this more. macnn points out  that this app requires xcode and runs from the terminal. ,1690,0,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/playfair-strips-drm-from-itunes/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/playfair-strips-drm-from-itunes/,,

trojan horse virus exploits weakness in mac os x ,Apr 8 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , though the mac platform is relatively free from the harassment of viral infections that regularly hamper wintel  users its not completely immune from the handiwork of those looking to cause mischief or harm. case in point:  intego developer of virusbarrier has put out a  security alert of the mp3concept mp3virus.gen trojan horse a  deceptive piece of code that couldandnbsp; easily be launched by mistake due to itand#8217;s fallacious cover. the code is hidden  away in the id3 tag of a seemingly benign mp3 file but stores hidden code that could possibly and#8220;damage or delete  files onandnbsp; computers running mac os xand#8220;.        andnbsp;this trojan horse has the potential to do any of the following:       andnbsp;- delete all of a userand#8217;s personal files       andnbsp;- send an e-mail message containing a copy of itself to other users       andnbsp;- infect other mp3 jpeg gif or quicktime files             due to the use of this technique users can no longer safely double-clickandnbsp; mp3 files in mac os x. this same  technique could be used with jpeg andandnbsp; gif files though no such cases of infected graphic files have yet been  seen.    not likely as dire as intego would like you to believe considering they specialize in viral protection software.  but definitely worth considering and being aware of. unlike condoms you donand#8217;t want trojan variety software for  protection. ,1425,2,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/08/trojan-horse-virus-exploits-weakness-in-mac-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/08/trojan-horse-virus-exploits-weakness-in-mac-os-x/,,

close windows save power,Apr 8 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , mac os x hints just tipped us off to a great way to save cpu power:            have you ever noticed that if you are downloading many things in safari and have the and#8220;downloadsand#8221; window open your  cpu usage jumps up? on my 800mhz g4 this can amount to 40%. if i close the downloads window or hide safari this usage  drops back down to 5%.    this got me thinking and it turns out that its the repeated updates to the window that crunches the cpu not the  downloads. by hiding apps you can reduce the number of cpu cycles they use as osx no longer has to re-draw their  windows when something changes. programs which show progress bars or other such frequent window changes are most  affected. ,707,0,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/08/close-windows-save-power/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/08/close-windows-save-power/,,

playfair is history ,Apr 9 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , earlier this week i was talking about playfair  the app that strips drm from itunes. well according to  macslash itand#8217;s been shut down.            and#8221;apple computer issued a cease and desist order to sourceforge to shut down the playfair web site cache. the  development team is currently looking for a new home for the project. itand#8217;s not surprising that apple did this but i  guess iand#8217;m still disappointed whenever they whack someone with a lawyer.and#8221; no proof that it was an apple candamp;d. you can  still find playfair in a sourceforge search but it returns a page saying and#8220;invalid project.and#8221; ,644,2,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/09/playfair-is-history/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/09/playfair-is-history/,,
trojan horse follow up ,Apr 9 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , the news of this trojan horse has been spreading  everywhere however miro a  boingboing reader has posted some  interesting follow up:               the mac os x mp3 trojan is being blown completely out of proportion. quick review of facts so far:    1. it was pointed out in a usenet thread that it is possible to embed arbitrary data in an mp3 2. it was  subsequently suggested that the arbitrary data could be executable 3. an enterprising developer proceeded to then  create a file which to any mp3 player will appear as an mp3 file but the mac os x finder sees it as an application 4.  an anti-virus vendor published advertising for their product saying that it has a cure for this form of trojan.    some other relevant points:    1. this has little to do with mac os x vs. mac os 9. the exact same file will do the exact same thing on mac os 9 and#8212;  be playable by mp3 players and act as an application 2. this has little to do with mac os x using extensions to  identify file types. the icon shown by the finder could be embedded in the file itself in which case the file would  look like an mp3 file regardless of its name. 3. this trick requires using the resource fork and therefore the file  has to be transmitted encoded. any mp3 file that is transferred as a plain binary file as opposed to a mac binary  file with the resource fork is harmless. 4. the fact that the file can be played in am mp3 player is irrelevant; if  the trojan were malicious the user would be doomed after double-clicking on it regardless of whether the file is a  valid audio file.    to summarize a mac application can have any icon or name whatsoever including a name and an icon that make it  look like a document. exactly what happens when you receive such an application in email or by downloading it in your  browser depends on your settings but i am not aware of any case in which it will be automatically launched.    therefore to activate this trojan you have to either receive a mac-encoded attachment and double-click on it in  the finder or you have to download a mac-encoded a file which is then usually decoded to your desktop and  double-click it in the finder.    the only reason that this is news is that a vendor of anti-virus software took it as an opportunity to generate  some advertising as far as i can tell. ,2326,3,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/09/trojan-horse-follow-up/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/09/trojan-horse-follow-up/,,
ipod rss ,Apr 10 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , you can get your rss feeds on just about anything now even your ipod. a program called ipod agent is supposed to do  that and a bunch of other things except itand#8217;s windows based so i and probably a lot of other mac people wonand#8217;t be able  to check it out. in addition to that daily wireless has a round of of readers for just about any mobile device you can  think of - pda smartphones spot watches etc. they talk about how this is strictly for early adopters now but  perhaps not for long.               in conclusion rss might be pretty good for mobile devices in fact i think itand#8217;ll be so popular its likely people  wonand#8217;t notice or care what it is or where it came from. it will be a pervasive part of our mobile device experience;  youand#8217;ll get news articles and posts from the blogs you like to read all on your mobile device displayed in a great  way. for now itand#8217;s a bit geeky not what anyone would call mainstream so perhaps this is just a crystal ball view but  itand#8217;s not a bad one.    thanks seven ,1056,1,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/10/ipod-rss/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/10/ipod-rss/,,
carbon fiber g5 powerbooks? ,Apr 12 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , this post from mac os rumors might be some of the coolest news  iand#8217;ve heard all week.            weand#8217;ve been hearing reports very similar to what has been making the rounds on the mac web like wildfire and#8212;  speculation about a powerbook g5 enclosure constructed from carbon fiber.    one specific type of carbon fiber mentioned by our sources is high-resin thermoplastic.    this material lends itself to sub-milimeter moulding precision at relatively reasonable costs and would allow for  surprisingly sleek lines while retaining the kind of thin enclosures weand#8217;ve seen since the introduction of the powerbook  g4. it could also allow for many passive cooling vents without sacrificing attractive looks.    anyone who has ever seen bare unpainted carbon fiber knows the beauty of its black-on-black weave and can imagine  many ways in which it could be made to bring back the days of the and#8220;armani suitand#8221; black powerbook with post-modern  style. ,988,1,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/carbon-fiber-g5-powerbooks/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/carbon-fiber-g5-powerbooks/,,

no more norton? ,Apr 12 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , there will be no future version of norton  utilities for macintosh and all development of the software has been shelved according to sources close to the  company. instead symantec will reportedly focus its development resources towards future consumer and corporate  versions of norton antivirus norton personal firewall and norton internet security.    this seems like an important announcement but i canand#8217;t  say itand#8217;s going to effect me much. i could never get a straight answer out of anyone if norton utilities was the best  or worst thing to run on your mac. since i first touched a mac iand#8217;ve had 4 complete meltdowns where i lost almost  everything on the disk actually i had backups for the later 3 but you know what i mean. in all of those cases the  super repair guys who helped me put my life back together blamed the crash either on my use of or lack of norton  utilities. when os x was released i started calling pro shops and one would say it was manditory the next would say  avoid it - so i just said forget it and havenand#8217;t used the app in years. i also havenand#8217;t head a meltdown in yearsand#8230;  hmmmand#8230;. ,1165,1,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/no-more-norton/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/no-more-norton/,,

delay cream on the g5 update dream ,Apr 12 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , apple insider has yet another  detailed report regarding power mac g5 update delays:        according to a reliable source apple was recently forced to completely rework the internal temperature sensors  inside the current g5 case design to accommodate the new 90 nanometer g5 processors. apparently the new 90nm daughter  cards have a different profile and seat position than the cards included in the initial power mac g5.           andnbsp;and#8221;the sensors were reading an incorrect temperature coming off of the heat-sinks and this would throw the fans  into a frenzyand#8221; one source said. and#8220;the fans would spin up to an intolerably noisy speed and then the machine would shut  itself down to prevent damaging the processors even though the internal temperature of the processors remained well  below 27-degrees celsius.and#8221;    low yields of ibmand#8217;s power pc 970fx chips at 2.0ghz+ speeds is also reported as a cause for the delay. i hope this is  not a redux of the problems apple had with motorola processor updates for those depressing lean sub 1ghz  years. ,1092,1,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/delay-cream-on-the-g5-update-dream/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/delay-cream-on-the-g5-update-dream/,,

ipod car mod ,Apr 12 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , iand#8217;ve got one of those casette adapters that i plug into my ipod for use in the car. it does pretty much what i need  it to do. a friend of mine went an extra step and had a wire installed into his stereo so he can skip the whole casette  translation part. thatand#8217;s enough for most people but for people like jesse melchior nothing short of a custom base is  going to do the trick.            i used the center console of my  car to sculpt an add-on piece that would house the ipod mini and connect it to my existing car stereo. i took a mold of  the final sculpture using l-200 latex and backed it with an ultracal 30 plaster shell to hold its shape. i then cast  the piece using dental acrylic. using the belkin car charger i connected it to the ipod mini and placed the ipod into  the acrylic piece at the angle i wanted then flipped the whole piece over and poured another layer of dental acrylic  over the protruding edge of the ipod mini and the car charger creating a perfectly snug fit for the ipod to rest into  and connect to the charger. ,1063,0,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/ipod-car-mod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/ipod-car-mod/,,

get back those missing mp3 ,Apr 14 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , when i used to work in the music industry i was always getting cdrs from bands of songs they were working on from a  live show or had just recorded in their own studios. in most cases the cdrs i would get would be one of maybe 3-4 in  existance and iand#8217;d have to send them on to someone else right away. in the old days people made casetre copies but this  was 1995 so iand#8217;d always make mp3s of these songs right away.            needless to say these songs were not in the cddb or available to be downloaded anywhere. one of my biggest complaints  with early versions of many mp3 players including itunes was that they would try to organize my music collection and  every time it did this iand#8217;d lose a bunch of these songs. theyand#8217;d just be gone. full drive searches and everything to no  avail. the only thing we could figure out was that since they had been made with all kinds of different software  mpecker etc.. itunes thought they were bad files and just deleted them. i still havenand#8217;t been able to replace a lot  of those songs.            subrosasoft just released  mp3restore which seems like it would  have been a lifesaver for me back then. this app is supposed to be able to find and recover mp3s that were accidentally  deleted or have gone missing from portable players or your own hard drive. oh subrosasoft where where you when i  needed you? ,1392,1,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/14/get-back-those-missing-mp3/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/14/get-back-those-missing-mp3/,,

ipod going down with the mac ship? ,Apr 15 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , despite all the evidence to the contrary weand#8217;re still reading that mac is minutes from going out of business. this  weeks death wish comes from cnet who speculates  that apple not jumping all over real networks offer is suicide and will end up dragging the ipod down with it. ew..  scary.            now realnetworks ceo rob  glaser and some others see the potential for history to repeat itself in the digital music world if apple persists in  keeping its software and hardware closed. apple has taken some major steps to avoid past mistakes notably making the  ipod compatible with windows pcs dramatically expanding its potential market. ipod sales last quarter helped apple  triple its earnings compared with the same period a year ago.    but thatand#8217;s a half measure according to glaser who recently quipped that apple might go the way of the soviet  union unless it takes a more liberal stance toward licensing its software specifically the fairplay digital rights  management drm controls that prevent songs purchased through itunes from being illegally copied.    and#8221;appleand#8217;s market share will go down if they continue to do thisand#8221; glaser said at last monthand#8217;s pc forum. he  predicted that customers will say and#8220;i bought an ipod and can only shop at one store. what is this? the soviet  union?and#8221; ,1358,1,0,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/ipod-going-down-with-the-mac-ship/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/ipod-going-down-with-the-mac-ship/,,
an isore? ,Apr 15 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , john king of the san francisco  chronicle makes a critical observation of appleand#8217;s san francisco flagship storeand#8217;s architectural presence today:        here we are at a prime corner on one of the busiest streets in one of the nationand#8217;s last vibrant retail districts  and the top two-thirds of the store is blank closed off. pedestrians walk below sheets of cold thin steel each wall  bare but for a backlit company logo.    considering appleand#8217;s historical dedication to the virtue of design iand#8217;d agree there is some validity in noting the  almost machine-made aesthetic architecture of appleand#8217;s retail locations in a city that prides itself in fighting  cookie-cutter urban development. but the sf writer seems to pine for the aesthetic of an apple of years gone by:        apple prides itself on curvaceous computers. its ipod minis come in five colors. iand#8217;d love to see the same design  flexibility where it would matter most and#8212; the world we all share.    curvaceous computers? seems like a case of g3 nostalgia in a g5 world since apple hasnand#8217;t released a curve-inspired  piece of hardware in quite awhile.        but my personal experience inside many of the california location stores has been nothing but sheer joy well  besides the pushy crowds that gathered around the g5s when first released and i appreciate the decision to move away  from the playfulness of the original imacs in both identity and industrial design. the interior architecture strikes me  as being both representitive of the post-fruitalicious-imac apple identity with the newest ipod minis even subtley  shaded in metallic colours and a retail experience that aims for inviting technological luxury. but maybe mr. king  has a point. apple could set aside their flagship stores with unique and challenging architecture interior and  exterior that would mirror their dedication to and#8220;think differentand#8221;. maybe future stores will come in silver gold  green pink or blue. ,2022,0,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/an-isore/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/an-isore/,,

gmail has .mac in itand#8217;s sights ,Apr 15 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , the people who complain about .mac have a new weapon on their side gmail. why pay $99 a year for .mac when gmail  offeres much of the same thing for free? thatand#8217;s what  business week online is asking  anyway.            when google adds the capability to download gmail to desktop clients then .mac would become basically a vanity  plate as an e-mail address. gmail will also take care of your anti-virus needs if you want it to. ditto for file  storage. most people store files as e-mail attachments anyway so .macand#8217;s idisk storage function becomes less  alluring.    that leaves mainly free web hosting web-design tools and system backup as .macand#8217;s standout offerings. theyand#8217;re nice  but hardly worth $100 per year when competing services cost the same or less. a company called xdrive offers 500  megabytes of storage for only $20 per year more than the cost of a .mac subscription.    they suggest the soultion might be some kind of apple-branded gmail super pack. i actually donand#8217;t know anyone who has  a .mac account but iand#8217;d like to hear from some people who do. what do you think about all this? why pay for something  when you can get it for free? ,1200,1,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/gmail-has-mac-in-its-sights/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/gmail-has-mac-in-its-sights/,,

ernie the attorney: the joys of apple computers ,Apr 16 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , last night i was thinking it might be cool to talk to some well known bloggers who use macs and ask them why. this  morning i wake up and see that  ernie the attorney has  beaten me to the punch and publically declaired his love of the mac. he wrote a pretty good rant on the subject but  this is the part i echo to all my pc using friends and family when they start compaining about some mis-configured /  crashing problem.            call me crazy but i think that computers should be so  easy to use that the word and#8216;configurationand#8217; becomes obsolete as a computer term. there are so many things about apple  computers that make life easier e.g. they rarely crash rarely need rebooting and simply donand#8217;t need to have the os  reinstalled every year as part of and#8216;routine maintenanceand#8217;. macs are more secure and not just because people donand#8217;t write  viruses for them. i could go on with all of the things iand#8217;ve learned about macs in the past year. but iand#8217;m really wasting  my time here because if you have a mac and run os x then you already know what iand#8217;m talking about. and if you only use  pcs then you are going to have to defend your choice which for many many people isnand#8217;t a real choice because they just  bought what the herd was buying; at least thatand#8217;s what i did up until a year ago.    but no one can dispute this statement: computers should be easy to use and they should as much as possible  configure themselves. having used macs and pcs extensively over the past 10 years i can tell you itand#8217;s not even a close  contest. apple computers are easier to use and configure.    bingo. most of the people i know who use pcs use them because thatand#8217;s what they always used and all their reasons  for not using a mac come from what they heard someone else say since they never actually used one themselves. in fact  iand#8217;d say 9 out of 10 of those people who in the last 4-5 years were given the opportunity to use a mac switched. my  mother-in-law uses a computer for e-mail web surfing and printing pictures from her digital camera yet scoffs at the  idea of using an apple. she doesnand#8217;t know much easier her life would be. ,2234,1,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/16/ernie-the-attorney-the-joys-of-apple-computers/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/16/ernie-the-attorney-the-joys-of-apple-computers/,,

emac speedbumps ,Apr 17 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , earlier this week we talked about the updated  emacs that apple was releasing but it looks like the new models might not be fully ready for primetime.  appleinsider has the scoop:            according to sources in manufacturing and reseller  channels apple has recently placed its 1.25ghz emac superdrive model on a short-term quality hold. while most  resellers have yet to receive the new desktop those who have are being instructed not to begin selling units to  customers.    in a memo to employees apple noted that there is and#8220;no confirmed problemand#8221; with existing inventory of the new emac  but acknowledged ongoing testing of the high-end configuration. appleinsider can only assume that a potential issue  relating to the computerand#8217;s new 8x super drive was recently questioned.    appleand#8217;s online stores in the us and uk currently reflect a 1 to 3 day delivery estimation for the 1.25 ghz combo  drive emac. however the stores estimate a 5 to 7 day and 2 to 3 week wait on the super drive emac  respectively. ,1045,2,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/17/emac-speedbumps/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/17/emac-speedbumps/,,
aol sucks even more ,Apr 18 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , os x users who still havenand#8217;t figured out what a nightmare aol is are getting a bit of a reminder this week according  to amy alkon. the advice goddess checks in with a  report of bugs and problems especially when it comes to mail.            for about a week aol keeps  saying itand#8217;s been a day or three daysand#8230;and has been since i called them to complain this past tuesday aol for mac os  x has been really buggyand#8230;spinning beach ball to get to your mail you click on a piece of mail and the cursor jumps  halfway back up your mailbox. after five tries maybe you can get to the piece of mail. replying is another story. the  experience of typing an e-mail is comparable to chipping out the words with a chisel but probably slightly pokier. aol  is very hush-hush about this issue and#8212; but if you call a mac os x tech at aol theyand#8217;ll tell you the last 20 people they  talked to just complained of the same issue.    apparently aol is and#8220;working very hardand#8221; to fix this. right. anyway the last tech guy i talked to and#8212; an american  with perfect english thank goodness and#8212; told me that and#8220;the address book isnand#8217;t populating.and#8221; iand#8217;m a bit dim when it comes  to making sense of technology but apparently your aol address book is also on their server and the corruption is  there up on the mother ship. ,1389,1,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/18/aol-sucks-even-more/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/18/aol-sucks-even-more/,,

overclocked powerbooks? ,Apr 18 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , the rumoristas seem to agree apple will be delivering a new line of g4  powerbooks and ibooks in the very near future monday?! with faster cpus larger hard drives more powerful video  cards and more configuration options. but exactly which cpu will be inside the new laptops is still in question.  insanely great mac compares the choices amongst contending  motorola powerpc processors: 7447 7455 and 7557. and their conclusion? the powerbook updates will be overclocked  and#8220;stopgap modelsand#8220; released to and#8220;give [powerbook] sales a valuable sales spike and keep appleand#8217;s bottom line  from haemorrhaging until the [powerbook] g5 is ready to ship.and#8221; if true its yet another strike  against appleand#8217;s desire to move forward with their product lines joining the recent ibm g5  debacle and emac refresh warning. ,847,4,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/18/overclocked-powerbooks/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/18/overclocked-powerbooks/,,
mac @ artwalk ,Apr 18 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , jeff koga checks in on laand#8217;s  brewery artwalk and while everyone else was looking at the  art he was scooping the hardware.        a running joke throughout the day that i participated in with jay was the  fact that whenever i entered a loft iand#8217;d check out the living space which was usually upstairs or tucked away behind a  makeshift wall and unavailable to the general public and look for the type of computer that s/he was using. usually  that computer was some kind of mac whether it be a laptop ibook powerbook imac g3 g4 or tower g3 g4 and i  even struck up a conversation with kathleenand#8216;s neighbor about her macs both of  which at the moment seemed to be nonoperational but every so often iand#8217;d spot a pc laptop or tower and that would  throw me out for a loop.    wil highly reccomends swinging by today if you missed it  yesterday. ,870,5,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/18/mac-artwalk/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/18/mac-artwalk/,,
