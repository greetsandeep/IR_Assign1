my google talk mac wish list ,Aug 24 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,analysis / opinion:&:software:&:internet tools , the interweb is all abuzz with google talk chatter. while we probably didnt really need a yet another chat client yacc google talk or gtalk as the kids are calling it is free based on open technology and the few hours we spent playing with it last night proved that it works. cant ask for much more than that. or can i? of course i can!the service and accompanying website only rolled out last night but already im finding things that should be present but arent. the help section on the google talk page for example refers to numerous pages that say nothing other than document not foundsorry the document you requested is not available.  you can return to the referring page.ill cut them some slack on that though. even google deserves a few days to get their act together. its still beta afterall.since theres no mac client those of us at tuaw and many of our colleagues across the weblogs inc. network were firing up ichat last night in order to test drive talk.google.com. with the exception of a bizarre half hour where i was demonically possessed the account setup went smoothly and within mere seconds of inputting the proper settings i was talking to friends and family who had gmail.com email addresses. thats my first gripe - asandnbsp; mac user without a standalone google talk client i was at the mercy of knowing someones gmail address in order to connect with them or having to look it up in one of my many address books. the windows-only google talk client has a built-in searchandnbsp; engine that culls from your existing gmail address book. there is no such search engine in ichat obviously.andnbsp; while i know that google cant dictate how third-party applications are built and how well those clients interact with their own service im baffled as to why they - once again - released a new service without a mac-compatible client. the glut of mac-based chat clients proves that it cant be all that hard to do. i expect more from google. after all they pride themselves on not being evil right?if im stuck using ichat which i use all day anyway so its no big deal here are a few features id like to have:more after the jump ,2145,7,2,17, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/24/my-google-talk-mac-wish-list/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/24/my-google-talk-mac-wish-list/,,,

google talk broadcast message ,Aug 24 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,internet tools , so last night while i was chatting away at the new google talk via ichat this little google broadcast message appeared:crazy! a google broadcast message over google talk that was only listed as gmail.com. i tried to add this to my buddy list hoping it was a bot b/c when i am bored i love messing with bots. anyway it wasnt and nothing happened.        anyway this got me thinking: big google brother can broadcast to all the users in gmail. if google ever rejects their dont be evil mantra this could be used for nefarious purposes. i dont think ive ever seen anything like this with any other chat services.        after sleeping on it ive decided that im not *furious* with google for failing to release a mac client yet. one is supposedly in the works and in the meantime google talk works with both ichat and adium. in ichat you can have audio chats with another person running ichat and my guess is that this is an ichat feature; i think the google talk account just handles the handshake between the two or more audio chatters and then it is passed along to another protocol. ideally however id want a mac client or a google talk plug-in for ichat. that would rock....oh and also server to server connections are needed so that google talk can communicate with the entire jabber sphere. do it google. do it now! ,1320,0,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/24/google-talk-broadcast-message/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/24/google-talk-broadcast-message/,,

mail act-on adds shortcuts for rules ,Aug 29 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:productivity , after dave caolo posted about the now-indispensible mailtags i couldnt help but delve into what other ingenious stuff could come out of the same company and found act-on. id just like to say up front: these guys are getting all my donations for the week. put simply act-on is a plugin that allows you to assign keyboard shortcuts to rules in mail. anything thats possible with a rule is now just a keystroke away. read on for an example of how it works and how much power act-on can give you over your mail messages.theres a simple naming process to follow for rules but once you  create one you simply must use the ` key above tab to invoke  act-on then use any of your shortcut keys to trigger a rule. to give  you an example to get the gears turning: ive now set up 4 separate  rules each to color the background of a message in mails list a  different color. coloring messages quickly and easily like this helps  out tremendously if i need to find a specific message in a list or  search result but you can do so much more. any rule you can conceive -  say one that colors a message moves it to a folder and runs an  applescript - can be called with a simple act-on shortcut. powerful  and best of all: handy. just like mailtags act-on requires panther or  tiger and a $20 donation is recommended. ,1303,2,2,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/29/mail-act-on-adds-shortcuts-for-rules/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/29/mail-act-on-adds-shortcuts-for-rules/,,,

apple reportedly planning .mac updates, numerous tiger bug fixes ,Aug 31 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,rumors:&:internet tools:&:software update , good old .mac. ive got an account and i use the heck out of it. the venerable service is probably a big reason my wife is in love with her ibook. since publishing movies and photos to our .mac pages is so simple shes gone from no computer to two laptops and even works online now... so ive gotten my moneys worth.still as some people have questioned earlier couldnt it do more? one of the hallmarks of the mac os is integration hardware software and services. that said integration embarrasses microsoft on a daily basis too. so its with a great smile that i read the latest scuttlebutt from appleinsider: updates to .mac coming soon. havent we heard this song before?unfortunately these arent the sweeping changes some might wish for but they are nice. most importantly backup.app gets a makeover. multiple backup profiles used to be a total nightmare. now that pain is eased and there are apparently multiple profiles built-in for backup of ilife data home folder data and settings. finally! also on the slate are those often-rumored by apple itself thank you .mac-exclusive widgets. i can only assume these will tie into .mac services but ive been wrong before.appleinsider also reports 10.4.3 is coming soon with around 400 bug fixes. no word on whether this will appease c.k. though. i hope the 367 bugs ive found get fixed. ,1331,4,0,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/31/apple-reportedly-planning-mac-updates-numerous-tiger-bug-fixes/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/31/apple-reportedly-planning-mac-updates-numerous-tiger-bug-fixes/,

why dont developers harness .mac? ,Sep 1 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:software , i love my .mac account. aside from the typical shortcomings some users complain about - zillions of gb of space idisk speed boosts etc. - i truly feel its an amazing concept with a ton of potential thats been implimented really well so far. but with all this power just lying around why arent more software developers leveraging the power of .mac?transmit my favorite ftp app uses tiger-specific .mac capabilities to sync favorite sites. i just downloaded smultron - an open source text editor that syncs preferences via .mac - on jays recommendation. this kind of stuff is incredibly handy and if you think about it: if more apps did stuff like this it would propel .macs usefulness to new heights. so whats the problem? are .mac subscription numbers growing slower than i thought? are developers having trouble finding the sdk? theres so much potential for .mac that my imac and powerbook are almost dripping with it. so i ask you tuaw readers: why havent more developers hopped on the .mac bandwagon? ,1005,4,0,36, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/01/why-dont-developers-harness-dotmac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/01/why-dont-developers-harness-dotmac/,,,

is the market ready for a video ipod? ,Sep 2 2005 12:00AM,jan kabili,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:video , is the market ready for a video ipod? realmoney columnist cody willard doesnt think so. i disagree. in willards opinion a video ipod will be successful only after large numbers of regular folk have been downloading videos burning them to dvds and watching them on their tv sets. willard analogizes to the ipod which he thinks was successful in part because it was introduced after mainstream consumers were used to trading music burning it to cds and listening to those cds in their cars and homes. the flaw in this analysis is the unspoken assumption that downloading video content is a new kind of consumer behavior. id argue that it is just another twist on downloading music. theres not much difference between downloading tunes podcasts or videos in terms of consumer behavior. the mainstream consumer now familiar with the concept of downloading content to a portable player already gets the drill. demand for video is growing quickly as evidenced by the popularity of sites like ourmedia. conclusion: the market is indeed ready and waiting for a vpod. bring it on apple. ,1079,2,0,21, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/02/is-the-market-ripe-for-a-video-ipod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/02/is-the-market-ripe-for-a-video-ipod/,,,

griffin updates the itrip ,Sep 2 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,hardware:&:ipod family , the griffin itrip is an fm transmitter for the ipod. ive been using one for about a year now and while i like it ive felt that theres certainly room for improvement. todays update looks like it makes some very nice changes including the issues that have bothered me the most.first of all the new itrip allows you to change transmission frequency by turning a dial on the itrip itself and a led display lets you know just what frequency youve got selected at a glance. no more fumbling for the itrip playlist while youre trying to drive your car!whats most interesting however is the itrips use of lx and dx modes of broadcasting. from the website: andquot;this allows the user to adjust for the absolute  best possible audio under real-world conditions. even in the toughest  situations such as large cities with lots of radio stations crowding  the dial itrips dx mode delivers a noise level thats below that of a  cassette tape adapter allowing the music to punch through cleanly. the  results are stunning.andquot; i know that a number of users have complained about the quality of the signal. i live in a rural area so i typically get a good signal but when im in boston i do end up fumbling around to find a good frequency. id love to try one of these out hint hint griffin. it looks like a nice update. the itrip is currently being offered at a special introductory price of $39.99us and works with ipod photo the ipod u2 special edition 4th generation ipods with click wheel and 3rd generation ipods with touch wheel and buttons.[via macminute]update: i just discovered that playlist mag recently published a review.andnbsp; check it out. ,1647,3,0,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/02/draft-griffin-updates-the-itrip/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/02/draft-griffin-updates-the-itrip/,,,

microsoft messenger 5 stuck in 1995 ,Sep 4 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:software:&:internet , i was really excited when microsoft announced they were resurrecting the msn messenger - now rebraneded as microsoft messenger - because they boasted it offered chat network inter-operability a la adium and proteus. but to my surprise in order for microsoft messenger to work with other chat networks you have to be running through a little piece of software called live communications server 2005 from microsoft on your network. as you may guess it isnt cheap. but this post isnt about a misguided promise its about how ugly and andquot;1995andquot; this newest version of messenger is. look at that window!  just to go on a sunday rant here: is anyone actually clicking on the andquot;sendandquot; button in a chat app anymore? if so does it really need to be that gargantuan? i have widgets smaller than that thing!now i havent touched a windows machine or its chat apps in a couple years now but i know ichat adium and i believe even proteus on osx these days have more or less eliminated all traces of that useless button. so what is a ui hand-me-down from 1995 doing on a spankin new brushed metal osx-friendly re-branded version of microsofts messenger? a tiny thing to complain about i know but that button and the andquot;dont click on stuff from people you dont know!andquot; warning that cant be shut off give this app such an air of juvenility. am i alone on this one? someone raise a hand! ,1404,2,0,30, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/04/microsoft-messenger-5-stuck-in-1995/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/04/microsoft-messenger-5-stuck-in-1995/,,,
re-mount an ejected drive ,Sep 4 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,hardware:&:peripherals:&:software:&:tips and tricks , this is a small tip but for those who constantly work with external hard drives this might be a bit of a time-saver.typically if you eject an external drive on jaguar panther or tiger and want to mount it again you have to power cycle the drive or unplug then plug it back in. if your drive is in a tough-to-get-at spot or possibly across the room these methods might get a bit obnoxious. fortunately i found a handy trip around this: if the drive has been ejected but is still powered on simply start up disk utility to find the drive listed but greyed out. click on the drive hit the mount button in disk utilitys toolbar and stay in your seat for once to let your drive come running back into your desktops arms.[via hints andamp; tips] ,741,1,1,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/04/re-mount-an-ejected-drive/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/04/re-mount-an-ejected-drive/,,,

tabs in itunes 5.0 ,Sep 7 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,ipod family:&:its , ok before i write anything else let me say i was wrong. to quote myself: andquot;...why would apple move to a flash-based ipod mini? isnt it the shuffles role to go after the flash-based music player market? apple typically keeps very distinct lines between products and as such i dont see a andquot;mergingandquot; of the hard drive players and flash players.andquot; eh what do i know? anyway here are a few observations on the day.ive finally had a chance to sit down and check out itunes 5. ive got to answer c.k.s poll with a thumbs up. i really like the new tabs in the itunes music stores front page. now we can view eight albums at a time and jump between genres easily. thats pretty nice but for me this update is all about the folders in the playlist column. for clutter-phobics like me thats a dream come true. more after the jump. ,844,3,0,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/07/tabs-in-itunes-5-0/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/07/tabs-in-itunes-5-0/,,,
itunes 5, i am jacks dull surprise ,Sep 7 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:its:&:itunes , allow me to play devils advocate for a moment. or as i like to call it theandnbsp; john c. dvorak punditry game. i wont just be discussing itunes 5 but all the musical announcements rolled out from apple today.first of all i think theres no way youre going to have another revolution on your hands as you did when the first ipod was announced. video ipod? no by the time that rolls around the psp/xbox/dingus synergy will be there. dont get me wrong a video ipod will be cool and maybe sell well but the revolution will not be televised.instead of revolution we got a minor evolution. its a shame apple portrayed this as the second coming of woz. personally im a little nonplussed. so the mini is gone. as some of you have pointed out we now get a full 2 gb less storage for the same money. a color screen? its smaller? i believe adam sandler said it best when he said andquot;whoopadeedoo!andquot; it would appear apple is sacrificing choice for simplicity. thats their way of course but must we all be a party to it? im not saying they should go the route of creative and come out with a dozen dinky players none of which are worth the time to reason with... but variety is the spice of life you know? ,1205,3,0,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/07/itunes-5-i-am-jacks-dull-surprise/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/07/itunes-5-i-am-jacks-dull-surprise/,

i dont want an itunes phone ,Sep 8 2005 12:00AM,jan kabili,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:itunes , i may eat these words but i really dont want an itunes phone and i dont want my kids to have one either. no im not that old nor that grumpy. i just got a chance to sit down and take in the entire quicktime webcast of yesterdays announcement of the itunes phone. when i got to the part where cingular the exclusive carrier for the itunes phone proudly shows off its upcoming tv ads i found myself cringing. one ad features a young guy walking along with music playing in his ears fantasizing about dancing to the music oblivious to the real world around him. when his phone rings the music pauses for just a second -- just long enough for him to blurt out an abbreviated response -- and then its back to the music and living in his head. sorry but this isnt my view of utopia. i have no desire to be plugged into a music player and a telephone all day long. id rather have all my senses tuned into the real world. so call me a throwback. i can take it. ,953,1,0,20, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/08/i-dont-want-an-itunes-phone/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/08/i-dont-want-an-itunes-phone/,,,

why an itunes phone instead of software? ,Sep 8 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:itunes , i was chatting with c.k. today about why apple motorola and cingular shook hands on an itunes phone instead of apple just going ahead and making a client probably in java so that all sorts of phones could use it. i was listening to a great podcast inside silicon valley itms link that presented an insightful answer to this very question and i tend to agree. heres how it breaks down: since the wireless networks have been talking about debuting their own wireless download services for phones for a while now apple probably wouldnt have made a whole lot of headway into this mobile phone music market without coming up with something they could sell to both a wireless provider and a hardware manufacturer. by working with motorola and cingular to create a dedicated and *exclusive* itunes phone everybody wins: apple gets to sell more music the wireless networks rake in precious boatloads of new subscribers and motorola gets to sell a ton of special little phones.while i really dont want one of those phones - im heading out the door soon to pick up a 4 gb black ipod nano - this reasoning makes a lot of sense to me. anyone else want to weigh in? ,1154,1,7,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/08/why-an-itunes-phone-instead-of-software/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/08/why-an-itunes-phone-instead-of-software/,,,

30gb ipod to replace 20gb ipod? ,Sep 8 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family , with all the ipod nano hubbub swirling about today this one was kind of easy to overlook. if you attempt to purchase a full-sized ipod at the online apple store youll see the graphic at right which lists your options as 30gb for $299us and 60gb for $399us. yet in actuality you can only purchase either a 20gb or a 60gb pod. is this simply the result of an error in the art department? i would say yes but since both the size of the ipods hard drive and its song capacity have been altered im inclined not to. it seems kind of odd that someone would make an error on both of those statistics. if it said andquot;30gb/5000 songsandquot; it would be easier to write off as a mistake. i guess time will tell.in the meantime what do you think tuawers? error or omen?thanks barb! ,776,2,0,23, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/08/30gb-ipod-to-replace-20gb-ipod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/08/30gb-ipod-to-replace-20gb-ipod/,,,

things i want for my ipod nano ,Sep 10 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family , following up on my gushing first 24 hours report from yesterday id like to point out a few things that i find lacking in the ipod nano and some bits and pieces id like added down the road.      first and foremost apple needs to release black peripherals for the black ipod nano. i think it is ridiculous that my black ipod nano came with the same white earbuds that come with the white ones. i also think it is ridiculous that these same white earbuds are what have come with the u2 ipod. i kind of like the idea of the lanyard earbuds and id be tempted to buy one if apple has the common sense to make them in black too.      there are two other must-haves if i am really going to consider replacing my 60gb ipod with the nano: first there needs to be a new camera connector for the ipod nano either from apple or from a third party that will allow me to transfer pics over to the nano just like i do with the 60gb ipod. this should be doable if only apple will allow for this possibility. they may not because they may want to keep people spending more money for the feature-rich and larger 60gb ipod. the other thing i really need is a little more tricky because i dont even know if it is possible with the ipod nanos current architecture: audio recording attachment. i want an italk type device that clicks on the bottom and makes this thing record voice memos. that would be the coolest.      and finally heres a short list of third party peripherals that are feasible i hope to see and i will buy:  a black sendstation pocketdock for the ipod nano preferably with a usb-mini port so i can use the same usb cable i use to charge my razr connect my psp to my powerbook and connect my nikon d70 to my powerbook. one cable = good mobility.  a cigarette-lighter car charger/radio transmitter/dock for the ipod nano.  a pc-card adapter that will slide into the 15-inch powerbook i am getting that will serve as an ipod nano dock      if you build any of these things and you got the idea from this post then i want a freebie. thanks! ,2035,1,0,28, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/10/things-i-want-for-my-ipod-nano/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/10/things-i-want-for-my-ipod-nano/,,

is the powermac the odd man out? ,Sep 11 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:hardware , apple likes simplicity and they excel at making complicated computer and hardware purchasing choices simple for their customers. apparently simple means that the powermac gets no love from the rest of the mac family.  this is a snapshot of the top of apples general mac product pages. i was browsing for some details on my imac g5 when i noticed something odd about this lineup: the powermac isnt sitting alongside its brethren. while it kind of makes sense since the powermac is aimed for a slightly different audience i still think it should at least be obvious and available in that particular navigation i know its easy to get to from other main links since one never knows - the leap from an imac g5 to a work-horse powermac might not be that tough to make for more customers these days.am i over-reacting here? or is someone already proof-reading a site alteration petition for apple? ,892,3,0,13, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/11/is-the-powermac-the-odd-man-out/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/11/is-the-powermac-the-odd-man-out/,,,

managing downloads with firefox 1.5 beta ,Sep 11 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:tips and tricks:&:odds and ends , i havent seen this mentioned anywhere yet but upon opening the downloads pane of the firefox 1.5 beta preferences theres a andquot;view andamp; edit actions...andquot; button.  this opens up what i would assume is a not-quite-finished feature that appears to allow you to dictate what applications if any are used to open specific file types that you download. it seems unfinished as i cant find a way to add new types to this window - yet. i realize this can kind of be accomplished simply by using os xs get info command but i really hope mozilla finishes this feature to its full potential as it adds are serious layer of power to the downloading opening and installing experience of surfing the internets.on a bit of a personal note: if anyone out there is skilled at building safari plugins id be happy to drop a few bucks on something like this for apples browser. ,872,1,0,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/11/managing-downloads-with-firefox-1-5-beta/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/11/managing-downloads-with-firefox-1-5-beta/,,,

rokr aimed at the kiddies? ,Sep 16 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:itunes , i was listening to the inside mac radio podcast itms link that brought up a great point about the rokr that might put its less-than-spectacular introduction into perspective for anyone like me who just might be over the age of roughly 20: it might not be meant for us.i think it was their #12 or 13 episode but inside mac radio basically cited a survey they found as factual and reliable as surveys are  that a large amount of teenagers are after a mobile phone that includes a music player. now i know mobile phones are blowing up for teens right now and apparently device convergence is all the rage with the kiddies these days. in many ways i dont blame them. but this all seems to add up to the possibility that apple and motorola whipped out the rokr for the specific but large demographic of youngins who just gotta have both a hot mobile phone and their music all on a tight budget.any tuaw-reading parents out there care to weigh in? id love to hear peoples thoughts on this one as the rokr in my mind seems like a great concept that could simply use some evolution lovin to become a tad more appealing to an even larger audience. ,1140,1,0,21, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/16/rokr-aimed-at-the-kiddies/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/16/rokr-aimed-at-the-kiddies/,,,

video store? sure, right after ogg vorbis... ,Sep 19 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,analysis / opinion:&:its:&:rumors:&:itunes , jordan over at our sibling-site downloadsquad notes that ars technica has declared the rumors of apple offering an itunes video store official because of some icons found embedded in itunes 5.      i for one seriously doubt it. heres why: exhibit a. apple can not really announce an effective itunes video store until they have a video ipod. considering they just launched a brand new ipod line with the ipod nano i dont think the video ipod has any chance of materializing within the next 6 months. exhibit b. apple has had many odd and various icons embedded in itunes for many iterations with absolutely no materialization of any utilization of those icons whatsoever. for example there have been ogg vorbis icons for well over a year now but itunes still doesnt support ogg vorbis.    why do they do this? my personal theory is that apple coders plant little distractions like this in the code just to mess with all the rumor and fan sites. remember when the microsoft code was leaked and there were a bunch of comments in the code like this is a really ugly f-ing hack? thats the same thing going on with the mac coders except they actually *enjoy* the product they are working on so they build little fun things into it rather than embedding the code with complaints and curses.  this is just my theory though. they could announce a video store tomorrow for all i know. nothing surprises me ever since the great intel changeover announcement of aught five. ,1464,2,0,16, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/19/video-store-sure-right-after-ogg-vorbis/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/19/video-store-sure-right-after-ogg-vorbis/,

el gato releases eyetv ez ,Sep 22 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,multimedia:&:peripherals:&:video , one of these days im going to start posting about my experiences using el gatos eyetv usb wonder. the one with ati branding. but for those of you craving the terrestrial signals or just looking to plug that ps2 into your mac the eyetv ez is for you. looks like a cheap no-account cousin to the usb wonder. no fancy recording but you do get bus-powered magic. pop it into your usb port and away you go!if its like my eyetv youll need a factory-original usb 2.0 port last time i checked el gato wasnt supporting 3rd party add-on cards and some horsepower. the reason their latest usb gear is so cheap is because they no longer have mpeg encoding built into the device. rather the device relies on the macs cpu and software to encode the video. this was a problem for me because i had to have a dual g5 to record the best quality video... since it doesnt look like youll be allowed to record with the ez i guess youll just need the minimum g4 chip. ,947,1,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/22/el-gato-releases-eyetv-ez/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/22/el-gato-releases-eyetv-ez/,,
tip: quick hard drive access from the dock ,Sep 23 2005 12:00AM,jan kabili,tips and tricks , photoshop guru ben willmore uses this os x technique to quickly access files on his mac while hes teaching his popular photoshop seminars. its caught the attention of his students even though theyre supposed to be focusing on photoshop rather than os x. if it can distract people from learning photoshop from ben i figure its worth passing on: drag a copy of the hard drive icon from your mac os x desktop to the right of the vertical line on the right side of your dock. if your dock is vertical drag the hard drive icon beneath the horizontal line near the bottom of the dock. press and hold the hard drive icon on the dock to reveal pop-up menus of your file structure. now you can use the pop-up menus to quickly navigate your hard drive and access your files. ,766,1,0,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/23/tip-quick-hard-drive-access-from-the-dock/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/23/tip-quick-hard-drive-access-from-the-dock/,,,

quirks of the new .mac groups feature ,Sep 23 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:internet tools , while playing around with the shiny new groups feature of the recently upgraded .mac service i stumbled on some interesting tidbits in the faqs i thought yall might be interested in.first: anyone who wants to join a .mac group has to have a .mac id - including windows xp and linux users. i dont know about you but this seems like a bit of a stretch to force non-.mac members to sign up for a trial membership and be subjected to all the trial propaganda emails just to take part in a group. sure the user can still use the .mac id to access the group after the trial expires but it still seems like some out-of-place marketing to me.second: group idisk space is etched in stone at 100 mb. you cant allocate more or less from your idisk and at this time theres no way to even buy more storage for your group if you wanted to. seems a little shortsighted to me.now dont get me wrong. if you checked out our most recent podcast youd know im a .mac lover and ive already set up a couple groups for personal and academic use but im curious: what does everyone think about this new groups feature of .mac? ,1102,3,0,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/23/quirks-of-the-new-mac-groups-feature/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/23/quirks-of-the-new-mac-groups-feature/,,,
doctopus enhances your dock icons ,Sep 23 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,software , earlier today i came across doctopus an interesting little utility that allows you to put informative andquot;badgesandquot; over your dock icons. these badges look much like the message indicator that pops up in apples mail. for instance you can monitor the amount of free size available on a hard drive by glancing at a pie chart on that drives dock icon or quicky peek at ical events just by mousing over the ical badge.theres a universal andquot;launcherandquot; badge that you can assign to an applescript quickeys shortcut or automator workflow. ive been playing with it for about half an hour and it is pretty useful. the badges move in kind of an odd manner its hard to explain. they seem to andquot;hoverandquot; above the dock icons and they dont feel like theyre actually attached. a minor complaint for sure but if youve got magnification activated for your dock its a bit odd to see the tiny badges move just an instant after the icons move.still its worth checking out. theres a free 30 day demo available and a full license will run you $19.95us. doctopus requires mac                      os x 10.4 or newer and a 500 mhz cpu 1.0 ghz if dock magnification is enabled.[via spymac] ,1197,2,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/23/doctopus-enhances-your-dock-icons/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/09/23/doctopus-enhances-your-dock-icons/,,,

ipod nano survives trip through washing machine ,Oct 4 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,ipod family:&:odds and ends , the beautiful and tiny ipod nano is so small and light you could very well forget that its in your pocket. this could be a bad thing. joknee at macmerc recently had a andquot;nano vs. washing machineandquot; battle of his own. luckily the ipod came out the victor. upon first pulling the soaked little player from the washer it showed no signs of life. after an approximate 40 minute wait itunes recognized it and mounted it though there was considerable moisture behind the little pods screen see above. two days later its working fine. its the miracle of the ipod nano.this reminds me of my poor palm iiie. many years ago i ran into the house during a rainstorm and didnt notice that my palm had lept from my coat during the journey. it spent the night on my lawn in the pouring rain. upon first inspection i thought it was dead but after leaving it alone to dry for a couple of days it worked as it always had. this led me to be believe that it isnt necessarily the water that does the damage but the electricity conducted haphazardly through the device by the water that is no good. if you can resist the temptation to fiddle with your soaked electronic goodies and just let them dry out you may have a chance. of course checking your pockets in the laundry room is a good idea too. ,1288,1,0,21, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/04/ipod-nano-survives-trip-through-washing-machine/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/04/ipod-nano-survives-trip-through-washing-machine/,,,

record am/fm radio with radioyourway ,Oct 12 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,audio:&:hardware , heres a dedicated device by pogo products that looks and functions much like an ipod except that it acquires music by recording am or fm radio. the radioyourway uses up to ten timer recording presets to record your favorite shows. once youve captured your audio you can transfer it to your mac via usb the website says that a firewire andquot;upgradeandquot; is available but doesnt give more information than that. you can actually record from any audio source which the radioyourway converts to mp3. it will play mp3 wma or rvf files and can also be used to store data files. there are currently two models available: the radioyourway lx 128mb which offers 8.5 hours of recording time and costs $199.99us and the lx 512mb which clocks in at 34 hours recording time and runs $249.99us. there is a european version of each model as well which ships with a 220v ac each with the same price point in us dollars.looks interesting. kind of a hard sell to someone who already owns an ipod who needs two devices but if radio is really all youre interested in carrying around it may be worth checking out.[via your tech weblog] ,1122,2,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/12/record-am-fm-radio-with-radioyourway/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/12/record-am-fm-radio-with-radioyourway/,,,

you can burn itms video files... ,Oct 13 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,its:&:software:&:video , ...just not in itunes. i wanted to clarify the issue surrounding burning videos from the itms that c.k. briefly touched on in his review of the new service. basically: you cant burn the video files to a cd or dvd in itunes whether just a data backup or otherwise but burning them straight out of the finder works just fine. going up to andquot;show song fileandquot; in itunes or using the shortcut cmd + r will reveal video files in the finder in which case you can burn them up yourself. the one thing it appears you cannot do is burn a disc that is playable in a set top dvd player or other computer - youreandnbsp; restricted to only creating backups outside of itunes. c.k. noted that this is probably due to how long it would take to recompress the video into dvd-ready mpeg-2 files but i think it has more to do with the deal apple had to make with the tv networks.i personally feel like this is a lame restriction. we should be able to burn a backup of our purchased content from within itunes instead of going through extra steps and hunting through the finder. ,1072,1,0,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/13/you-can-burn-itms-video-files/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/13/you-can-burn-itms-video-files/,,,

apples video moves in the big picture ,Oct 13 2005 12:00AM,jan kabili,analysis / opinion:&:its:&:multimedia:&:one more thing , now that the rush from discovering what new goodies apple has in store for us dies down we can step back and take a look at the larger picture painted by apples moves in the video arena. apple hasnt just given us a snazzier ipod and access to a few entertaining videos. arguably apple is changing the face of media distribution in a big way. tim bajarin at technology pundits calls apples deal with disney making abc tv shows available for download andquot;a stroke of geniusandquot; because andquot;this alone will cause the hollywood tv studios to beat a path to apples door to get their offerings on the new itunes video store as fast as possible. since apple uses fair play drm they can use this new tv itunes store to show the movie moguls their environment is safe...with this move apple is actually showing the hollywood producers that digital distribution of any content is safe and secure and that apple gives them a new way to distribute their content to the entire marketplace.andquot;if bajarin is right that will mean more legally downloadable video content for you and i to enjoy on our ipods macs or even pcs. by keeping the price down to $1.99 per episode apple makes that content attractive to consumers. that is likely to keep demand up which in turn should bring television and movie producers to the table with new downloadable content. and that changes the face of major media distribution significantly. the more i think about it the more i agree that this is another big groundbreaking move on apples part. what do you think? ,1550,1,0,25, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/13/apples-video-moves-in-the-big-picture/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/13/apples-video-moves-in-the-big-picture/,,,

impressions of a new palm t|x ,Oct 14 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,peripherals:&:portables:&:reviews , for those who didnt hear palm announced a couple of new handhelds this week and one of them is the palm ive been waiting for all my life: the tungsten t|x. its basically a t5 with wifi bluetooth and 128 mb of ram and im fortunate enough to be holding one in my hand. yep even as i type this. i just cant put this bad boy down.ive uploaded a set of opening and unpacking pics to our tuaw flickr account. in a week or so ill post a more thorough review but for now i thought id post a few initial impressions in case anyone else out there is thinking about grabbing one of these:the t|x is just slightly heavier than than t5 - no surprise.it has a dark steel blue body but in most light it almost looks black to mesoftware install and setup went just fine including enabling the isync conduit im running tiger 10.4.2. calendars contacts and todos are syncing perfectly.wifi works well and it maintains a strong signal. one quirk so far: the t|x couldnt connect to my airport express with wpa security enabled. guess i need to learn a little more about wireless security compatibility.the screen is bright. really bright. i havent compared with another palm yet but this is the first palm ive having to turn down the displays brightness on a bus ride home at night.there is no andquot;disk modeandquot; application like the t5 and lifedrive have. i dont know yet if i can download this from palm but out of the box i dont see another way of mounting the t|x as a drive like the t5 and lifedrive.there is also no andquot;file browserandquot; application either. more investigation pending.this seems to be the first palm made during/after palms recent re-naming as the name atop the device is andquot;palmandquot; not andquot;palmone.andquot;  all in all im happy with the device. ive installed a few standard programs like a newsreader and everythings humming along just fine. ill work everything into a comprehensive review examining this device as a mac pda but in the meantime feel free to ask me anything youd like to know in the comments of this post. ill try to answer as many questions as i can. ,2101,2,0,28, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/14/impressions-of-a-new-palm-t-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/14/impressions-of-a-new-palm-t-x/,,,

is oss on osx just plain wrong? ,Oct 16 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:software:&:odds and ends:&:freeware:&:bad apple , all i wanted to do was check this list over at newsforge on andquot;using open source software on max os x.andquot; what i found in the comments were some of the most vitriolic anti-mac sentiments ive ever read. and i read that infamous mac mini review a couple of times. the contention of several commenters is that apple has 1 tried to make a profit and 2 given nothing back to the oss community.i cant argue with number one there. since we live in a capitalist country it is fairly natural that a company founded by people who like to eat every day would attempt to create value and gasp profits for the company. guilty as charged. im not sure why this is inherently evil but then i never understood that whole bolshevik thing either. i guess by this logic cars gas ipods cheetos floor wax and movies should be free as well. good luck on that one gang.as for number the second i guess thats the topic for debate. how much has apple given back? one person comes to their defense citing darwin konqueror khtml and opengl. i have to agree with opengl because we really need that. do we want another microsoft monopoly directx? while there was a little controversy around konqueror a while back those issues seem to have settled down. darwin though? yeah i guess thats an option. one of the best examples of apple giving something has to be rende...  uh bonjour. while its still a pretty early stage for the protocol i  feel it has tremendous possibility and has only just begun to be used.as for the list at newsforge it is oddly placed. apple has nothing to do with linux. most of the apps on the list weve mentioned here before: adium growl seashore clam av pixen vienna cyberduck dtv smultron vnc apps and applejack. i cant seem to find preferential treatment though... im still not sure how oss on the mac is bad for oss. how is it worse than oss on windows? and at the end of the day isnt anything not made by microsoft a good thingtm? ,1942,19,0,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/16/is-oss-on-osx-just-plain-wrong/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/16/is-oss-on-osx-just-plain-wrong/,,

andquot;videoandquot; ipod vs. psp ,Oct 17 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,audio:&:gaming:&:ipod family:&:video:&:odds and ends , ive noticed several posts around the web comparing the psp to apples new video-capable ipod. psp world has an editorial on the topic that despite the sites clear psp-leanings finds somewhat in favor of the ipod in terms of video content noting sony needs a strategic plan that includes easy-to-use cross-platform media organization and transfer software reduced storage pricing and an easier way for psp owners to access digital content. playlist also compares the two devices and makes a similar comment noting that the ipod is smaller and lighter and can hold a lot more content too. but perhaps the most important factor in the ipods favor is a content delivery system through the itunes music store that makes it a lead pipe cinch to get video onto your ipod. the psp has a new stream tv to the psp over the internet option in the form of a locationfree player that streams video from your tv dvd or dvr to your psp but only if you spend an extra $250 on the locationfree device.        so as a blogger for tuaw and author of a forthcoming book on the psp what do i think? why does this have to be a vs. situation? both devices rock. the psp is a gaming system. the ipod has much more storage space and is better geared to be a great multimedia storage and viewing device. cant we all just get along? buy one of each!      what do you think? ,1347,4,0,16, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/17/video-ipod-vs-psp/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/17/video-ipod-vs-psp/,,

one step dvd to ipod ,Oct 17 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,ipod family:&:video:&:how-tos , i played around with converting some dvds i own to the correct size for the new video-capable ipod this weekend. i know this process can go much faster for those of you sporting g5 processors but on my 15-inch powerbook the process eats up a lot of time. close to 5 hours to rip and convert an entire dvd following the procedures outlined here that scott mentioned before. however the part that didnt make sense to me was the first step using mac the ripper.       handbrake is perfectly capable of circumventing the decss on commercial dvds so there is not really much reason to first rip the video to hard-drive using mac the ripper before converting again using handbrake. maybe on g5 systems this would speed up the entire process no need to slow down for dvd access during compression but on my g4 i found that skipping that first mac the ripper step and selecting the dvd itself as the source for my handbrake conversion sped the entire process up by an hour. still 4 hours is a lot of time to waste processing video. itll be nice when movies start showing up in the itms for $1.99 a pop. ,1096,3,0,26, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/17/one-step-dvd-to-ipod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/17/one-step-dvd-to-ipod/,,

synchronizer brings some .mac to firefox ,Oct 18 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:productivity:&:tips and tricks:&:internet tools:&:mods , im a safari man at heart partly because syncing bookmarks between a few macs with my .mac account takes a big headache out of my daily computing. however since i still need to work in firefox for a few things ive been on the hunt for a tool or extension to bring this same bookmark syncing goodness to firefox.fortunately my quest has ended in success with the bookmarks synchronizer. this slick little firefox extension enables bookmark syncing via any good ol fashioned ftp/webdav server and for the past couple of days its been working like a charm. you can set the extension to sync at the startup and/or shutdown of firefox which also works really well with one minor catch: quitting firefox causes this extension to kick into syncing action which effectively stops firefox from actually quitting so the sync can finish. once a small progress window disappears signalling a successful upload you can then truly quit firefox.im using firefox 1.07 and the extension works just fine. the mozilla download page makes no mention as to whether bookmarks synchronizer works with the 1.5 beta so youre on your own there. but if youve been looking for a way to cut down on computer-induced headaches and an easier way of keeping all those bookmarks n-sync hah! i definitely recommend downloading bookmarks synchronizer. ,1317,2,1,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/18/synchronizer-brings-some-mac-to-firefox/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/18/synchronizer-brings-some-mac-to-firefox/,,,

apple terminal server in the future? ,Oct 19 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,analysis / opinion:&:multimedia , chris howard over at apple matters thinks so and he thinks the new imac is the warm-up. the problem with the new imac as chris sees it--and i agree--is that its an inelegant solution to the media center problem. its one thing to have itunes video on your personal computer to watch lost episodes while youre procrastinating but once the computer becomes a media center its no longer personal. it becomes well a center; communal property that the whole family wants in on. some people want to watch videos while other people are working. others want to listen to music while others are watching videos while others are trying work. and i want them all to go away and stop reading over my shoulder and let me check my livejournal friends list in peace.andnbsp;the new imacs though like all their predecessors are fundamentally single console machines: only one person can be sitting in front of the computer at a time running a single application in the foreground. if someone else in the room wants to use itunes i have to give up my spot at the desk and go do dishes or something. as long as the only way to use the computer is to sit in front of it or across the room from it then a media center pc isnt much of a media center...or much of a pc as far as that goes.andnbsp; there are ways around some of these issues x-forwarding vnc nfs but for the most part they arent really for public consumption and require at least one extra computer and a lot of free time. but it doesnt have to be this way. ,1502,1,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/19/apple-terminal-server-in-the-future/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/19/apple-terminal-server-in-the-future/,,,

new imacs not final cut pro 4.5 friendly ,Oct 21 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,video:&:apple professional:&:imac:&:bad apple , lance writes in with this bit of warning for any fcp 4.5 users thinking about upgrading to a new imac: if you are wanting to use fcp4.5 with the new imacs you are out of luck. 4.5 doesnt support the new graphics cards. and there wont be a software update; just got off the phone with apple. so my grading of the new imac right now is suck although i havent tried front row so that might make me feel better. had i known i would have bought one of the old ones. but i got apple screwed. so i guess ill have to upgrade. suck. let everyone else know just in case they are debating between an old imac or the new one. it wouldve been a great short form dv cutting machine. and it still will for another $300-$500.      this seems like a bad move on apples part. i mean if people are suing over scratched ipods apple might want to avoid giving people more reasons to get upset. i know they want everyone to use the latest and greatest version of fcp so that they can sell more copies but graphic card support on a standard machine shouldnt be the issue that makes an older version of the software stop performing properly. couldnt some of the coders who have been spending their time writing things like photo booth get up and actually write some useful code like a fix for this and throw in an iphoto update while youre at it?        lance adds photo booth effects unfortunately made a few of us at work laugh out loud. so it is kinda fun. thanks lance! ,1451,1,1,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/21/new-imacs-not-final-cut-pro-4-5-friendly/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/21/new-imacs-not-final-cut-pro-4-5-friendly/,,

first impressions: apple lanyard for ipod nano ,Oct 21 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,accessories:&:ipod family:&:reviews , i just received my ipod nano lanyard from apple in the mail today and ive posted a flickr set at our tuaw account. i ordered this thing only a few days after the nanos were introduced and i just received it today. my initial impressions after walking around the apartment and playing with the cabling are really good and here are some thoughts:this things awesome. seriously.check out the flickr set for a closeup pic of the actual connector that hooks into the dock and headphone ports. it makes a nice solid connection that grips the nano well. im not worried my nano will accidentally fall off except for maybe while running which i wouldnt recommend with this lanyard anyway - an ipod bouncing around on a cable like this probably isnt such a good idea in the first place. on an unrelated note: i know my desk is in need of some touch-up love. this lanyard and ramen trumped the purchase of a can of pledge this week.the lanyard adjusts to a flexible range of lengths. i think just about anyone - short tall large or small - should be nice and nerd-stylin with one of these.some people are reporting the headphones sound better than apples standard ipod headphones. i havent noticed a difference but they do sound at least just as good.did i mention this thing is awesome?  im really pleased with the purchase. while i think apple is charging a little much at $40 i bought it for $35 at educational discount i really like this lanyard and recommend it for anyone whos still on the fence. ,1493,4,0,23, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/21/first-impressions-apple-lanyard-for-ipod-nano/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/21/first-impressions-apple-lanyard-for-ipod-nano/,,,

terminal tips: the ipods file structure ,Oct 21 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,ipod family:&:terminal tips , i decided to launch the terminal located in /applications/utilities/ to take a look at the file structure of the new ipod. i was curious to see if there were any changes from the previous ipods and to see if the video files were stored in a separate directory. the answer to both proved to be no. i had hoped that perhaps i would be able to find a way to have the shows i grabbed off of my replay tv actually show up under tv shows rather than under movies. unfortunately i had no luck with that bit of categorization which must be hard-coded into the itms-purchased tv shows. the video files are all mixed in with the music placed in the f** folders inside the music folder located inside the ipod_control directory. the video files are also renamed in the annoying four character file names that the music files have been since apple started having itunes scramble the names to make it even more difficult for us to grab our music off of our ipods. the movie file i open with open epqz.m4v at the end of the list of commands was an episode of lost.  check after the jump to see the full output from my browsing around via the terminal. heres a short explanation of the list of commands i used: cd changes the directory ls lists the files in the current directory and open opens the file named. ,1297,0,0,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/21/terminal-tips-the-ipods-file-structure/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/21/terminal-tips-the-ipods-file-structure/,,

so whos this damien barrett guy? ,Oct 22 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:blogging , i spent my childhood moving every year or two--my family lived in places like american samoa england an indian reservation in south dakota and even yellowstone national park for a summer.when i was 10 my family moved to england and lived on an american communications base. the after school activities at the school on the base tended towards what the volunteers from the base could teach and so leaned a bit heavily towards computers and technology. so at ten years old i was learning to write simple programs in basic fortran and pascal. after moving back stateside i continued my computer interests and started building computers from parts ordered out of magazines.in college i toyed with getting a cs degree but decided i liked working with people too much and so got a teaching degree. after teaching for a few years i moved to nyc to work with computers. i worked for a few years at an apple authorized service provider where i got to solve all kinds of wacky mac problems and occasionally got to work on a celebritys mac or two. for about a year i was teaching apples mac os x server classes as an apple certified trainer. currently i work for a university as a mac specialist and help maintain several hundred macs in a large sprawling and complicated network of labs classrooms and faculty offices.ive been blogging for more than 7 years. my identical twin brother cam was one of the very first to popularize blogging as a format and he taught me the ins and outs of blogging. im looking forward to blogging for tuaw and sharing what i know and find with the tuaw community. ,1586,3,0,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/so-whos-this-damien-barrett-guy/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/so-whos-this-damien-barrett-guy/,,,

terminal tips: centericq open source chat aggregator on os x ,Oct 22 2005 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,software:&:open source:&:terminal tips , in my everlasting quest for the best multi chat protocol client i decided to check out centericq. the centericq chat client despite its name also supports aim and .mac accounts yahoo jabber and therefore peripherally talk.google irc gadu gadu the polish chat protocol and msn. the client is purely terminal based. after trying centericq for a few days i must conclude that there are a few things left to be desired. i didnt enjoy the annoying key combos to bring up menus esc-esc [wait then] b for the basic menu or the mislabeled menu keys that obviously are already assigned in os x f9 f2 etc. to change between chat conversations the key combos actually work on os x ctrl-b or ctrl-n to scroll forward or backwards. the msn compatibility incidentally is broken on os x and other bsd systems for some reason: no m$ chat for you! other downsides for centericq are the lack of accented character support even though my terminal supports it and some irc anomalies. all things considered ive decided that centericq is the most stable and intuitive terminal based chat client.read on for installation instructions particular to os x after the jump. ,1147,4,0,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/terminal-tips-centericq-open-source-chat-aggregator-on-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/terminal-tips-centericq-open-source-chat-aggregator-on-os-x/,,,
first impressions: tunewear prie ambassador case for ipod nano ,Oct 22 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,accessories:&:analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:reviews , in addition to the lanyard headphone nano case i received yesterday from apple i also picked up tunewears prie ambassador leather case featuring both a removable hook/carabiner system and a belt clip. after playing around with it for a bit ive posted another flickr set and taken closeup pics of some parts that i think tunewears site could do a better job of showing. overall i really like this case as well so heres some of my thoughts thus far:the case is fortunately a little thinner and lighter than i thought itd be. most other leather cases ive used have been a bit on the thick side.the clear plastic covers used to allow access to the screen click wheel and engraving area on the back are nice and clear. operating the click wheel through the clear plastic takes some getting used to. a little more pressure is required but i think its definitely usable especially considering the protection benefits and how well the nano scratches.opening the clasp at the bottom of the case opens up plenty of room to plug in the ipod cable so you can keep your nano protected virtually all the time if you like.the metal hook feels really sturdy as its nice and thick. removing the hook from the case is a breeze as well.attaching the plastic hook to the back of the case is a minor pain the first couple of times as the leather is still really tight and unforgiving. after a little while it loosens up enough to make the process easier yet it still remains snug enough to alleviate any fear of getting too loose.  the case overall feels really well built and thought-out and for $50 it darn well better be. im not quite as hip on the red stitching but thats obviously a lot more of a preference issue. feel free to ask questions in the comments and ill do my best to reply. ,1772,4,0,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/first-impressions-tunewear-prie-ambassador-case-for-ipod-nano/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/first-impressions-tunewear-prie-ambassador-case-for-ipod-nano/,,,
fix for sluggish 5g ipod interface ,Oct 22 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,ipod family:&:tips and tricks , so you bought one of the new 5g video ipods and have loaded it up with all your music and album art. but you notice that the interface is much more sluggish than previous generation ipods! scrolling through your list of songs is significantly slower and gameplay when playing the andquot;brickandquot; and andquot;parachuteandquot; games with a song going in the background is unacceptable! fortunately theres a fix. it has to do with your album art not being optimized on the ipod. heres how to fix it.1 plug your ipod into your computer and open itunes preferences.2 in the ipod section of the preferences turn off the andquot;album artandquot; option.3 disconnect your ipod and reconnect it to update the ipod.4 now go back to the preferences and re-enable the andquot;album artandquot; option.5 youll see itunes begin to optimize the album art related to your songs. this could take several minutes depending on how much album art you have in your itunes database.when youre all done the 5g ipods interface should be nice and snappy again.note: the default state out of the box is that ipods automatically update/synchronize with itunes therefore these directions are written assuming that state. if youve turned off automatic updating on your ipod these directions wont work for you. in that case youll have to manually update your itunes by deleting your music from the ipod and then recopying it back to your ipod. also i havent tested this as i dont have a video ipod and c.k. hasnt been around but it seems to make sense. let us know if you encounter this problem and how this solution works for you. ,1611,0,1,17, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/fix-for-sluggish-5g-ipod-interface/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/fix-for-sluggish-5g-ipod-interface/,,,
putting the pod back in ipod ,Oct 22 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,ipod family:&:rumors:&:apple , its no secret that microsoft has been aiming its sights at capturing the emerging media center market. theyve released a version of windows called microsoft media center and they are building into their xboxes some media center functionality. but what about apple? apc magazines dan warne believes apple is about to enter the media center market. he makes the following points:apple has just released an ipod with video playback functionality.apple simultaneously released an imac g5 with media center software called front row and a remote controlapple is now selling good downloadable videos via their itunes store.the mac mini shipped with a mysterious but unused firewire bus speculated as being for an ipod dock in the minis case.  now to me this sounds like a recipe for an apple media center of some type. how long before we see a revised mac mini with a built-in ipod dock? imagine being able to store your songs movies photos saved games and files on your ipod and then being able to detach it and carry it over to your friends house and plug it into his/her apple media center unit.years ago there was discussion about why apple named the ipod the ipod. why not something exclusively music-related as thats what its role seemed to be. what if apples been thinking long term this whole time and the ipod will actually become a andquot;podandquot; you carry around between your physical locations. apple appears to be putting into place all the elements necessary for a successful release of a media center. i know i would be waiting in line with credit card in hand. ,1577,3,0,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/putting-the-pod-in-ipod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/22/putting-the-pod-in-ipod/,,,

tuaw video podcast: ipod edition ,Oct 23 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,ipod family:&:video:&:podcasts , so i spent a good chunk of yesterday putting together our first video podcast for your viewing pleasure and then a much larger chunk of time compressing and recompressing the video in an attempt to get it down to a tolerable size that would also play on any video-capable ipods out there. the subject matter of the video podcast is of course the new 5g ipod. to create the video podcast i attached my isight to a tripod plugged it into my powerbook and then launched quicktime pro and chose fileandmdash;>new movie recording. then i took the resulting video files and imported them into imovie did some basic editing added a few titles and then shot the whole thing out into the default h.264 ipod format defined by quicktime. the result? a ten minute file that weighed in at 50mbs in size. thus i began my compression quest.      i was chatting with matt croydon during all this and he pointed me to two useful links on compression: here and here. i managed to get one mp4 file down to 18mbs in size but when i tried to load it to my ipod it didnt want to play nice although it still plays fine in itunes. i then referred back to this apple document paying close attention to all that information in small print at the bottom of the page. the result this time: a ten minute file that weighs in at 43mbs. bah. the file should be embedded in our feed and show up in the itms sometime soon. in the meantime heres a direct link to the file right clickctrl+click and save please. if you dont need ipod playability and just want to watch it on the web or in itunes heres a link to the smaller 18mb version.        if any of you happen to be compression gurus skilled in the dark art of codecs please share your arcane wisdom with us in the comments.        update: after some more investigation it doesnt look like the widescreen off mode actually crops or at least it doesnt just crop as the video appears a bit thinner and squished when that mode is employed on a widescreen file. ,1979,7,10,22, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/23/tuaw-video-podcast-ipod-edition/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/23/tuaw-video-podcast-ipod-edition/,,

reader report on front row ,Oct 23 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,software:&:imac , tuaw reader and personal friend lance was kind enough to send me two rather long emails detailing his first and second impressions of front row on his brand new imac. so heres the second of those emails for your edification broken up into the negatives the positives and the strange bits about front row: negative. ipod is a no show. doesnt show up in your menu. so you have to have songs on the hard drive and in itunes to choose your music. photo slideshow. it is great except that that stupid ken burns effect is on and there is no way to turn it off. so you cant just see your photos because it is randomly zooming and panning and cutting off someones head. can anyone verify the ken burns part? i think it is most likely the default and would hope that there is a way to turn it off that lance has overlooked because apple has made it hard to find why are preferences for things getting harder and harder to find in apple land?. lance continues with the somewhat negative noting apparently there is no way to interact with front row except through the remote. no other way to open the application except with that little remote and its menu button. so dont lose the remote! there needs to be some other way to open the app through the keyboard or an icon. that is just strange...unless the real purpose of this application isnt for a computer with a keyboard...      more after the jump... ,1396,0,0,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/23/reader-report-on-front-row/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/23/reader-report-on-front-row/,,

a shortcut for zooming windows ,Oct 23 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,os:&:software:&:tips and tricks , im huge on keyboard shortcuts. i mean: huge. i dig through quicksilvers documents whenever i have time to learn more about all the insanely handy things it can do and im still waiting for a andquot;keyboard shortcuts and youandquot; book to show up at amazon.one thing thats always irked me is even though os x and most of the apps i use are fairly well thought-out in their design and use of common shortcuts theres one option i use on a frequent basis in a lot of apps thats never had a shortcut: zoom also known as the green andquot;best fitandquot; button in the top left of nearly every window. earlier this week i noticed this option is located in *nearly* every apps menu under window andgt; zoom and i realized: why dont i just assign my own shortcut? while this tip might sound like a no-brainer to some ive met enough people who had the andquot;oh thats so obvious! why didnt i think of it?andquot; reaction so i figured id post it: if you want a system-wide shortcut for this often-used feature or a shortcut for almost any other apps function that doesnt already have one just head into the keyboard and mouse system preference pane in either panther or tiger and open the andquot;keyboard shortcutsandquot; panel. click the plus sign to add your own shortcut and make sure andquot;all applicationsandquot; is selected in the dialog then type in andquot;zoomandquot; for the menu title. chose your own shortcut wisely so it doesnt conflict with other applications and *bam* - you now have a handy keyboard shortcut for an often used but sorely overlooked feature of os x that should work in almost every app even carbon ones like firefox and the finder. youll probably need to restart any running apps for it to take effect but if you did this correctly your new shortcut should show up under the window menu as in the picture accompanying this post. ,1864,1,0,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/23/a-shortcut-for-zooming-windows/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/23/a-shortcut-for-zooming-windows/,,,
who needs front row? i have salling clicker and a palm ,Oct 23 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:software:&:tips and tricks:&:imac , im starting to think front row is a little overpriced. why? because front row at least for now only comes on a shiny new imac. i have a previous generation imac g5 at my disposal and for the mere price of a wifi palm tx $299 and salling clicker 3.0 $23.95 i can do just about everything front row can and more - thanks to clickers friendliness with applescript. sure scotts solution for using the palm as an itunes remote might be a little cheaper but for a more robust expandable and all-encompassing solution i really think clicker has the one-up on apple.clicker works with a variety of macs and a whole host of devices from mobile phones to pdas. with my palm the imac and an airport express ive got one heckuva slick setup for controlling the music that plays in most of the apartment in the palm of my hand. hah! get it? this setup would fully trump front row if i was fortunate enough to afford a mac mini with wifi to just stick right next to our tv and stereo in the living room. then id have video images audio and more importantly - anything else that applescript would allow. in addition to audio and video i can view new mail messages new headlines in netnewswire and iphoto images right in my hand almost anywhere i go in the apartment - and thats with just the base install of applescripts that come with clicker.ive only been playing with this setup for a couple days now but so far its been bliss. if the airport express did video id be sending everyone in the engineering teams at apple and salling a very very large batch of cookies. ,1554,4,0,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/23/who-needs-front-row-i-have-salling-clicker-and-a-palm/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/23/who-needs-front-row-i-have-salling-clicker-and-a-palm/,,,
add a word count to textedit with nanocount ,Oct 24 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,software:&:tips and tricks:&:freeware , the less running on my wimpy little 800 mhz ibook the better. i know some folks around here *cough*c.k.*cough* have to tough it out on their shiny new powerbooks but my little sub-ghz g4 whomps them soundlyandmdash; in the latency division... so i dont always have the processor cycles to spare for word or openoffice. especially when all i need is a little word count love. and counting words on a 12andquot; screen is no fun either. since all my favorite apps except one are tiny little single-purpose apps with a small footprint i was ecstatic to find yet one more to add to the heap: nanocount. its a simple little floating window app that when youre using textedit will keep a running count of words in your current document. switching to another document will reset the counter and switching between docs keeps the count accurate across them.a new version just came out compacting the window and adding a couple of fixes and features. now for you writers pro or student out there one handy feature is a word count goal. setting this enables the little progress bar to andquot;fill upandquot; or progress as you type towards your final word count goal. this might have come in handy for this guy... remember nanowrimo starts in a week and you gotta keep track of those 50000 words somehow... ,1298,3,0,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/add-a-word-count-to-textedit-with-nanocount/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/add-a-word-count-to-textedit-with-nanocount/,,

hotmail not passing emails from mail.app ,Oct 24 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,bugs/recalls:&:troubleshooting , an interesting trend has been observed by quite a few people on apples message boards. seems microsofts hotmail servers are not properly passing emails sent from people using mail.app. it is not an isolated case and has been ongoing for quite some time. a user will send an email via one email client thunderbird for instance and it will go through fine but an identical email sent via mail.app just disappears into the ether.the only good news here is that microsoft appears to be aware of the problem according to some isps and is working on a fix.update: one work-around as posted in the link provided above and by tim below is this. if youre having this problem send an email to yourself with the recipients email address in the cc field. the email to you wont come through but the copy sent via the cc field will. no idea why but it seems to work. ,854,3,2,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/hotmail-not-passing-emails-from-mail-app/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/hotmail-not-passing-emails-from-mail-app/,,,

os x more secure because of fewer compromises? ,Oct 24 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,os:&:security , im sure weve all heard our fill of arguments as to why os x is more secure than windows but today i found one at macnn i dont think ive heard before: os x makes fewer compromises than windows in terms of backwards compatibility with previous os versions so says a businessweek article. this totally makes sense as os 9 and os x go together about as well as the latest ipods and firewire....or do they? we can run os 9 in the classic environment inside of os x even on the latest macs available - i should know as this weekend i had to learn how to install classic on my fiances imac g5 running tiger simply using the original system discs that came with the mac. i was able not only to install os 9 apps for her but it seems like i can leave them lying around almost anywhere i want and add them to the dock - right alongside os x apps.case in point: i would argue that os x isnt more secure simply because apple took fewer compromises - os x is more secure because apple knows how to compromise right.[thanks for the edits everyone!] ,1036,2,0,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/os-x-more-secure-because-of-fewer-compromises/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/os-x-more-secure-because-of-fewer-compromises/,,,

listing of mac os versions and builds on computers shipped since 1999 ,Oct 24 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,hardware:&:os:&:apple , apple has a handy chart to help you figure out what the earliest version or build number of a particular os you can install on any given mac. and it really is handy if you manage an office or lab full of macs that run off a standardized image. every time a new mac arrives those images need to be updated so that they are capable of booting the newest mac in the house while still being backwards compatible. this often involves trickery hackery and the occasional sacrifice of small furry animals. for most of you this will never be an issue but were not all lucky enough to be you. booting from too early of an os build even if its the same version can cause unwanted results ranging from inability to boot at all to loud fans raging uncontrollably displays looking crappy cd/dvd burners not being recognized or trackpads not working.in case you were interested the 3 most recently announced macs all ship with different tiger build numbers. the   power mac g5 late 2005 ships with mac os x 10.4.2 build 8e90 the   imac g5 isight ships with mac os x 10.4.2 build 8e102 and the   powerbook g4 double-layer sd ships with mac os x 10.4.2 8e45. in comparison my home desktop has a 10.4.2 build number of 8c46 as of the last software update. your build is probably the same if youre running 10.4.2 unless you purchased your computer very recently. to find out which build youre running click on about this mac in the apple menu and then click on the actual os version number version 10.4.2 for example. when you click it changes to the build number and if you click again youll get your serial number.in theory the latest build number should be perfectly usable on all prior macs provided they are compatible with the os in the first place. the ability to count past 100 tells us that the new imac with build 8e102 is going to be the basis for the new image ill need to prepare this week. i hope your week has more fun in store than mine! ,1937,4,0,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/listing-of-mac-os-versions-and-builds-on-computers-shipped-since/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/listing-of-mac-os-versions-and-builds-on-computers-shipped-since/,,,

finderpop is back! ,Oct 28 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,software:&:productivity , finderpop is back! i almost cant believe it im so excited. finderpop was one of those mac os 9 utilities that i absolutely couldnt live without. it made my days with mac os 9 bearable. and now this essential utility is available for mac os x.heres how i use it. if youre like me you tend to download a lot of graphics files pdfs and video files from the internet. and while most of us know that its easy to set the default application to be used to open for instance and .avi file theres no easy way to select which application you want to open a particular file. and so you end up right-clicking on a file and navigating to the andquot;open withandquot; contextual menu option and then waiting for your system to offer you a list of which applications can open that type of file. it works but is a bit cumbersome. finderpop makes this process a lot easier by allowing you to list aliases to desired applications directly in the finders contextual menu. like so:and you can do this with any application and file types. open a text file in a list of chosen word processors or a pdf file with preview instead of acrobat reader. use dropstuff to stuff your files.of course you could litter your dock with all these applications and get the same type of functionality but i think finderpop is a much slicker and more efficient way to manage this type of file/application launching.once youve gotten the hang of the core functionality of finderpop youll discover there are many more things you can do with it. the included readme file explains.finderpop for mac os x is still in beta but the author is actively working on it. hooray hooray finderpop is here to stay! ,1663,1,0,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/28/finderpop-is-back/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/28/finderpop-is-back/,,,

apple wireless routers receive highest rating in pc mag survey ,Oct 28 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:airport , apples airport base stations scored highest in pc magazines 18th annual reader satisfaction survey just ahead of linksys and cisco.andquot;apple wireless routers receive this years highest overall rating score 8.9. this is especially noteworthy given that in general wired routers outscore wireless. part of its high ratings may stem from ease of setup: apple routers tend to be connected to simpler-to-do-everything macintoshes.andquot;when my clients ask for recommendations on a wireless router ive oscillated between apple and linksys. i usually recommend the apple airport base stations for small apartments or for people who will be managing their own networks. and i recommend linksys wireless routers for large apartments or businesses because of their wider variety of security options. ive also installed d-link buffalo and netgear routers with varied levels of success. my experience mirrors this surverys results.if youre building a wireless network larger than a single airport base station i highly recommend you investigate the options that exist for extending the wireless range of the routers. ive had poor luck with unpowered hawking and dr. bott antennas but have had excellent success with the external antennas sold by quickertek. im certain this is becuse the quickertek antennas are powered and the hawking and dr. bott antennas are not. the unpowered antennas just didnt boost the wireless signal anywhere near as much as the powered quickertek antennas.and remember that these antennas only work with airport extreme base stations unless youre willing to hack your earlier model.of course your results may vary. any success or horror stories you guys want to share? or maybe a voodoo black magic story about a wireless problem with no apparent cause? ,1777,5,0,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/28/apple-wireless-routers-receive-highest-rating-in-pc-mag-survey/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/28/apple-wireless-routers-receive-highest-rating-in-pc-mag-survey/,,,

zdnet tells job hunters to stop using macs ,Oct 28 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,analysis / opinion:&:enterprise , according to zdnet an increasing number of companies are preventing mac browsers from accessing their online job listings and/or shutting them out of the online application process because the underlying software on their website only works with windows. american express target and sears are just a few of the companies that use brassrings software to manage their online job sites and its not mac-friendly at all. andquot;however we are seeing a gradual increase in demandandquot; said brassring spokesman doug jensen. andquot;therefore brassring enterprise 8 which is coming out in december will be firefox-compatible to support mac users.andquot; now... was that really so hard?its inexcusable in my book for any company especially a fortune 100 company like amex to make essential online resources off-limits to an only-growing population of mac users. sure there are ways around the andquot;no macs allowedandquot; barriers but there shouldnt have to be. an online job bank should be barrier-free to anyone and everyone who wants to access it and its probably just lazy stubborn or inexperienced programmers that are responsible for this problem to begin with. perhaps if more mac users could access those job boards they could apply for those programmers jobs and rectify these problems a lot faster! ,1309,3,0,18, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/28/zdnet-tells-job-hunters-to-stop-using-macs/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/28/zdnet-tells-job-hunters-to-stop-using-macs/,,,

first quad g5 shipments confirmed by nasa ,Oct 30 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,hardware:&:humor:&:powermac g5 , for some good sunday humor i stumbled on a spoof post over at macenstein claiming that nasa has spotted the first dual core dual g5 powermac in a city in illinois. a mock thermal image andquot;confirmsandquot; the location while a nasa rocket scientist warns the machine is only running in sleep mode and that no one knows what could happen if the owner were to start it up to check email let alone render a scene from maya.while this is pretty funny i really think fabienne was on to something when she posted about liquid cooling systems causing shipping delays. the dual 2.7 2.5 powermac g5 was the first to have a cooling system and now theyve stuffed the equivalent of four g5s into the same box? id be surprised if apple didnt just take a cue from the best mac ever that c.k. found and started using refrigerators as the new powermac cases. now that would be a real innovation. ,885,2,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/30/first-quad-g5-shipments-confirmed-by-nasa/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/30/first-quad-g5-shipments-confirmed-by-nasa/,,,
a microsoft catch-22 ,Oct 31 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,internet:&:troubleshooting , get a load of this. i try to use the festering bowl of pus that is internet explorer 5 as little as possible but keep it around for those few websites that require internet explorer. however iandnbsp; support thousands of users who do use ie5 regularly. most of them simply dont know any better and continue to use ie5 installed on their systems despite the superior alternatives that exist. i even install these alternatives on their machines but like pavlovs dogs they are conditioned to repeat their behavior. ah but i digress.a few years ago microsoft started making http://www.msn.com the default homepage for their installations of internet explorer 5. i didnt personally like the move but at least i knew how to change my default homepage. the majority of my users do not know how to do this and so end up just as microsoft planned staring at msn.com every time they launch their browsers.now this is relatively harmless behavior until you take into account a change that microsoft made either late last week or sometime this weekend. theyve made a change to http://www.msn.com that crashes internet explorer 5 for the macintosh. yup thats right...microsoft has changed the coding on the default homepage for their ie5 browser on the mac that crashes the very browser in question. and it gets worse. since the only easy way to change the default homepage in ie5 is to do it in the browser itself in the preferences and the browser is crashing with a spinning beachball of death sbod when you launch it theres now a classic catch-22. how can users change the homepage to something else if you have to do it in the browser but the browser crashes loading the page?fortunately there is a way around this. you can hit the command and period keys immediately after launching ie5 to stop the page from loading and therefore stop the browser from locking up. then you can go to the internet explorer menu and select preferences. click on andquot;browser displayandquot; in the list and youll be able to change ie5s default homepage to something other than msn.com.ive tested this on macs running mac os x versions 10.2.8 10.3.9 and 10.4.3. internet explorer 5 on all of them behaves exactly the same way crashing trying to load the msn.com homepage. discontinued browser or not i feel its inexcusable for microsoft to change their browsers default homepage without testing it against all the latest versions of their own browser for each platform. congratulations microsoft for reaching a new level of cluelessness ive never seen before. way to go.updates:11-01-05 8:40am: microsoft has changed msn.com to fix this problem.11-01-05 1:53pm: now msn.com is crashing ie5 again. ,2676,0,1,43, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/a-microsoft-catch-22/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/a-microsoft-catch-22/,,,

mac wiki guide from macrumors ,Oct 31 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,hardware:&:software:&:cool tools:&:education:&:internet tools , looks like macrumors has a few more tricks up their sleeve besides the obvious as theyve launched a wiki guide to all things apple and mac. i dont know how this stacks up to the likes of the wikitosh but ive already learned a few things just browsing through such as the old-school adb port that offered an advantage or two over todays usb.macslash where i found this notes that macrumors isnt attempting to create some definitive encyclopedia. instead it sounds like theyre just trying to organize the massive amount of information their forums seem to collect. i tip my hat to whoever had that crazy idea. ,609,4,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/mac-wiki-guide-from-macrumors/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/mac-wiki-guide-from-macrumors/,,,
speculation: apples foray into the media center marketplace ,Oct 31 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:rumors:&:itunes , its time for good old-fashioned speculation and rumor-mongering. over a year and a half ago i wrote on my personal blog about the airhub a fictional apple device that was a sort of upgraded airport base station...a wireless router with a built-in hard drive that could act as a home media device. this was seven months before apple released the mac mini which some people have started to use an a home media server. you might make the case that the mac mini is the airhub but with extended functionality. but what if apple takes the idea even a step further than releasing an imac with media center functionality software? ,624,1,0,17, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/speculation-apples-foray-into-media-center-marketplace/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/speculation-apples-foray-into-media-center-marketplace/,,,

samsung begins work on itunes-like product ,Oct 31 2005 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,its , choi gee-sung head of digital media at samsung electronics speaking at a south korean press conference on friday announced the development of an itunes-like software. it isnt clear despite the plethora of articles on this subject whether they are planning to make a software player or launch a music download service or both. perhaps samsung isnt happy after a chip deal fell through with apple earlier this month. we dont speak korean but apparently choi talked some smack at the press conference. he said andquot;that samsung mp3 players were superior to apples but suffered for not having a music service.andquot; riiiiiiight. ,631,2,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/samsung-begins-work-on-itunes-like-product/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/samsung-begins-work-on-itunes-like-product/,,,

wu-tang thinks differently ,Oct 31 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,audio:&:cult of mac:&:odds and ends , wu-tang the original is actually down to three members: gza the rza and u-god. but their new album andquot;think differentlyandquot; guest-stars a bunch of underground artists. personally it didnt make me think differently at all. im more partial to danger dooms new album.the only reason i even bring it up is as you can see the logo on the front of the album. unfortunately as an album i agree with keri carlsons review. the albums disparate themes and rhymes remind me of the sprawling performa line actually.andnbsp; i dont agree with carlsons statement: andquot;as much as think differently preaches the independent attitude the macintosh logo on the cover distracts. think different might be appleandrsquo;s motto but using the rainbow-striped apple only makes the album seem like an advertisement.andquot; i think its an homage to a different era. one where the original wu-tang was intact and one where people really were encouraged to think differently. besides apples logo hasnt looked like that in a while. at this point its more likely to confuse the average ipod owner... ,1086,3,0,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/wu-tang-thinks-differently/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/wu-tang-thinks-differently/,,

front row downloads point to mac security problem ,Oct 31 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,analysis / opinion:&:software , every time i write about mac security i get lots of comments telling me that mac users dont need to use anti-virus software that worms trojans and viruses arent available for os x so why bother? people seem to think that since os x might be a little tougher to hack than windows that we mac users are immune to nefarious script kiddies.sure there may be a sliver of truth to that but lets take a look at the recent spate of mac users downloading various versions of both photobooth and front row onto their macs. these folks download this software from jobs knows where and run it on their machines. the packages prompt for your password and bam! you have just given total control of your mac to some random application you downloaded from the net.there have been no reports of harmful software masquerading as front row or photobooth but the mac community is an easy target for one resourceful rapscallion to exploit the strange combination of apple lust and security that most mac users have.if youre going to download software illegally at least scan with clamxav before you run; itll make me feel slightly better. ,1119,2,0,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/front-row-downloads-point-to-mac-security-problem/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/31/front-row-downloads-point-to-mac-security-problem/,,,

broken shell script paths in automator 1.0.2 ,Nov 1 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,software:&:software update , ive only noticed two minor oddities on my imac since upgrading to mac os 10.4.3. first my spotlight hotkey combination has been switched back from f1 to the default command-space bar i had been using command-space bar for quicksilver. secondly my dock is once again white with a pronounced border i keep it transparent with transparentdock. both are easy fixes or will be as soon as transparentdock is updated. however some folks at macosxhints have found a change that could be more disruptive. it appears that shell script paths may be broken in automator 1.0.2. from macosxhints:andquot;...the problem is that the path returned by get selected finder items isnandrsquo;t usable by the run shell script action. so if you have a script that first gets the  selected finder items and then tries to run a shell script on the  selection it will fail.andquot;eventually the author noticed that if you first take an action on the path it will be workable by run shell script. just select something innocuous like label finder items with label set to andquot;none.andquot; pretty odd. has anyone experienced this issue?[via automator world] ,1137,5,0,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/01/broken-shell-script-paths-in-automator-1-0-2/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/01/broken-shell-script-paths-in-automator-1-0-2/,,,

pro photographers take a look at aperture ,Nov 2 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,software , aperture isnt out yet but already there is a fairly comprehensive overview of the product by a couple of real life photographers who havent been paid by apple. there is lots of great info in the overview some of which went right over my head im not photo buff. the most interesting thing to me is the fact that apertures library the central file repository will be more akin to what we know as a package i.e. a file that looks like it is a single file but is in fact a number of files and directories bundled together. a hint of what is to come for iphoto perhaps?also of note is the concept of a vault which is basically a section of the library that you have set aside and saved to a different location. the library still contains the original raw image but the vault has a copy that is updated every time the library original is. nifty.i cant do the article justice so go ahead and read it for yourself.found via digg. ,923,4,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/02/pro-photographers-take-a-look-at-aperture/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/02/pro-photographers-take-a-look-at-aperture/,,,

have you backed-up today? ,Nov 2 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,software:&:productivity:&:tips and tricks , theres nothing worse that losing data from a failed hard drive. its why so many people so strongly recommend backing up your data. if you dont have a backup routine in place start one today. the old adage andquot;its not if but whenandquot; applies here. if you havent had a hd failure yet you will some day and then that backup will start looking mighty handsome.fortunately there are a number of backup solutions for mac os x: carbon copy cloner superduper rsyncx retrospect sychronize pro just to name a few. even apple offers a program called backup with their .mac service. they all work with varying degrees of complexity. some of these are even free.if youre new to the idea of backing up i suggest reading matt hendersons excellent write-up about how he backs up computers at his workplace. i use a similar set up to back up my data at home.most hard drives shipped in the last several years have built into them a technology called s.m.a.r.t. self-monitoring analysis and reporting                 technology. it allows the hard disks to self-monitor several important attributes of a disk and report back to the end-user if somethings about to fail. most disk utiility programs now will tell you if a s.m.a.r.t. test has failed including disk utility techtool pro and diskwarrior. s.m.a.r.t. is great but doesnt help you if you dont actively look to see if a s.m.a.r.t. test is failing. heres where i use a menubar application called smartreporter. it lives in your menubar and will quite simply warn you if a s.m.a.r.t. test has failed by turning its icon red instead of green.it can also be set to send you an email if it detects a s.m.a.r.t. failure. i run this on several servers i maintain.tell us about your backup routines or your horror stories? what recommendations do you have for backup software or which do you think readers should avoid? ,1862,7,1,24, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/02/have-you-backed-up-today/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/02/have-you-backed-up-today/,,,

of course apple isnt moving away from their roots ,Nov 4 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:ipod family , alright its my turn to rant this week today? and this time around its about an editorial i found at macworld that asks that question that just has to crop up every so often: is apple moving away from its computer roots?no. and as a general call-out: please stop asking this question every time apple introduces an ipod or a product that simply isnt a mac. just because apple is about the only computer company whos taking serious steps in marrying hardware software and entertainment - and succeeding - doesnt mean theyre suddenly going to start peddling nothing but music and videos while they throw macs into the dumpster. the article even goes back and forth citing one over-paid analyst after another who say yes theyre still a mac company/but their venture into downloadable video could signal a move away from hardware. guys: this really should stop. apple is a hardware company and that means macs ipods and any other gadgets they have cooking in the labs as you read this. they create fantastic software products and services that drive the sales of said hardware. this unfortunately is why apple isnt opening the ipod up to other music stores anytime soon and its also why apple isnt porting all of their os x software to work on windows either. macs arent going anywhere. in fact with the future onset of faster smaller and cooler-running intel chips theyre only going to get better.[via macslash] ,1409,2,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/04/of-course-apple-isnt-moving-away-from-their-roots/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/04/of-course-apple-isnt-moving-away-from-their-roots/,,,
video ipodandmdash;not just for tv shows ,Nov 4 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,ipod family:&:multimedia:&:video , i dont have a video ipod and havent personally bought into the idea of watching tv shows on a 2.5andquot; screen. its not a bad idea and its clearly what some people want. what excites me however about the video ipod is what other uses may come from it. consider this:apple or someone builds a free subscription service that downloads overnight to your video ipod movie trailers and showtimes for the theatre or theatres nearest your zip code. want to watch a movie but dont know whats playing or the showtimes? no problem just fire up your ipod and watch the trailers and get the showtimes. credit to erik j. barzeski for this idea.local television stations realize they can get more people to watch their newscasts by offering them as a video podcast vodcast...what are we calling these now?. while i personally detest local news i know a lot of people that would want to download these newscasts.andnbsp; again it can be based via zipcode and stations could just set up a service that downloads overnight the 11pm news for viewers to watch during the morning commute. they might also just simply offer an audio-only podcast of the newscast for those people driving to work.youre traveling to another country as a tourist but are having trouble trying to decide which sights you want to see. you find an internet cafe and plug your video ipod into a terminal and are able to download tourist videos walk-along narratives and driving or hiking directions. alternatively you might load up your ipod with planned destination information before you leave. zoom and go.com are planning to offer some of this.its trivializing the video ipod to view it only as a way to view tv shows. im convinced that its versatility will offer interesting business opportunities for many companies. what other possible uses can you think of for the video ipod and dont say porn thats so overrated? ,1880,2,0,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/04/video-ipod-not-just-for-tv-shows/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/04/video-ipod-not-just-for-tv-shows/,,,

some ipod power tips from apple support ,Nov 7 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,ipod family:&:tips and tricks , ive found the apple support documents to be more and more of a useful resource these days as apples knowledgebase sometimes posts solutions to problems i didnt even know i had yet. go figure that one out. with all the new ipods fluttering around i thought it might be handy to post links to a couple of interesting support articles to help clarify some issues both new and old:    1 ipod: about sleep deep sleep hibernation and sleep timer. this explains the differences and advantages between sleep and hibernation states as well as which ipods support what. theres some neat stuff in here about the ipods power management i never realized and ive owned one of every ipod since the first 5 gb.    2 ipod does not work when plugged into a keyboard. im sure this one might be obvious to some but im meeting more and more computer users who dont understand why some ipods or external hard drives dont work when plugged into their keyboard. some devices require more power than those ports can supply so ill echo what this short document instructs: its probably a good idea to plug power-hungry devices like hard drives ipods scanners and printers directly into your computer a powered usb/firewire hub or ports on a powered display like apples cinema displays rather than an unpowered peripheral like a keyboard. this should keep everything running smoothly and will allow your ipod to get the juice it needs. ,1409,2,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/07/some-ipod-power-tips-from-apple-support/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/07/some-ipod-power-tips-from-apple-support/,,,

wanted: the ultimate copy and paste ,Nov 10 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:multimedia:&:os:&:software:&:switchers:&:features:&:internet tools , this morning my wife had an emergency with copying and pasting. she works online with a bunch of pc users all of whom naturally use the panoply of ms products: word internet explorer and windows. her assignment was to copy and paste dozens of web clippings into a word doc complete with formatting and links intact. sounds easy right? the clipboard is a miracle of modern computing. as usual things were harder than we thought. in windows since ms makes the whole widget or buys it from some other poor sap and tacks it into their stuff the windows clipboard pulls everything into it. the mac implementation of this process breaks down between the browser and ms word for mac. go figure.copying from any and all browsers using a simple copy/paste didnt carry anything but text at the worst formatting at best. there is of course paste special in word. unfortunately you have to be able to copy rtf into the clipboard from the browser. the only browsers that will apparently pass rtf into the mac clipboard? safari and shiira so i guess its a webkit thing. this makes sense as webkit is built by apple right? my wifes problem is that she doesnt like safari. she uses firefox. so my task is to find the perfect clipboard. iclip wont do it. anyone know of anything better? try copying some hyperlinked and formatted text out of firefox and into word. if the links carry over were in business and im back in favor with the wife. not that im out of favor but im the guy that sold her on the whole mac thing and now her coworkers are giving her a hard time. i mean copy and paste? we gotta fix this thing she was close to getting some switchers! ,1641,4,0,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/wanted-the-ultimate-copy-and-paste/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/wanted-the-ultimate-copy-and-paste/,,

apple said to be revamping genius bar appointment process ,Nov 10 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,  , speaking of horrific waits for service at apples genius bar one of those rumor sites that i try not to read i said try claims that apple is getting ready to ease the pain a bit by majorly overhauling their reservation system. according to appleinsider the new system will be called concierge and it will streamline the process and reduce waiting times considerably by funneling ipod-related problems and questions into a different queue which will be served simultaneously to those seeking other mac-related assistance instead of hogging the whole line. the new system is said to also feature a new interface intended to eliminate confusion about how to use it. that means more pretty icons fewer superfluous words. to top things off apple is also reportedly looking to increase the number of geniuses and creative bar staffers on hand in many stores.ive got nothing against the french but im a little bored with all the french names. cmon steve... enough already! ,966,2,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/apple-said-to-be-revamping-genius-bar-appointment-process/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/apple-said-to-be-revamping-genius-bar-appointment-process/,,,
starting your own pixar ,Nov 10 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:multimedia:&:software:&:how-tos , so you want to start your own animation dynasty like mr. jobs? well pixar released renderman for maya this week. renderman is the magic software developed in-house by pixar to andquot;drawandquot; the frames of their movies. having a bad renderer means slowness and images that just arent realistic enough. maya is an industry-leading modeling and animation tool. put them together and you pretty much have the mother of all animation pipelines. obviously theres a lot more that youll need for all that... but i decided to hop on the apple store and price a basic animation studio for you. please note this does not include the price of talent. i wonder what crispin glovers rate is these days?now mere animation and rendering tools alone will not suffice. you need to add music and voices too. apples logic should do the trick. plus youll need to edit this bad boy together. naturally apples final cut pro would be my choice although you could get the whole studio. on top of this there is often a need to andquot;compositeandquot; or layer rendered scenes. even the best 3d suites cannot sometimes handle the complexity of enormous sets and animations. or sometimes you just want to break things down to give you options when editing. either way a compositing app like say shake will let you render characters backgrounds effects and whatever you want separately then smush them all together in the end. this of course requires additional time and effort. but its what you do to make things perfect. and no one is arguing pixar would settle for less than perfect right? prices after the jump. ,1596,9,0,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/starting-your-own-pixar/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/starting-your-own-pixar/,,
shocker: staten island genius bar less crowded than soho ,Nov 10 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,retail:&:apple , i was flipping through an issue of time out new york tony to those in the know the other day in a hospital waiting room a place i am spending entirely too much time lately hence my sporadic appearances here but thats a story for another day and i stumbled across a little experiment that tony subjected some interns to. the test was simple: see if making the pilgrimage to the apple store at the staten island mall to consult with an apple genius would still be quicker for the average nyer than waiting for one in the soho apple store. they started two interns with ailing ipods off at washington square park on a saturday afternoon and sent one to soho a mere 15 minute walk away and one to the staten island mall which takes three different modes of transportation to get to subway ferry then bus. youyoung lee was the soho designee. she raced down to the apple store only to be told that there was currently a 7 hour wait and that even if she waited she still was unlikely to be seen since she had no appointment. and wouldnt you know it... there were no appointment slots left. on sunday at noon when she went to apples website to make an appointment she again found that there were no open slots left for the day. so she got up at 8am on monday and was finally able to book an appointment for 1pm. unfortunately when she got to the store she found that her name appeared nowhere on the list for the day! she inquired about why her appointment was gone and was told that some bonehead at the genius bar thought youyoung lees name was a joke so he deleted it. finally lee was ushered to the front of the line where it took all of 10 minutes for them to tell her that her ipod was completely dead and unfixable. elapsed time? 51 hours 10 minutes.rachel syme was the lucky one who got to go to staten island. while it took her almost 2 hours to get there it was worth the trip. once she arrived at the apple store in the si mall she was grateful to see that no previous appointment was needed. she just typed her name into the system and 30 minutes later she was face to face with one of apples finest. of course they couldnt fix her ipod either and it took her another 90 minutes to get back home but her suffering was quick and painless compared to poor youyoung lee. elapsed time? 3 hours 15 minutes.now as an elitist new yorker i am often harsh on staten island. but ill admit that the ferry ride is scenic relaxing and you cant beat the price free as in beer. if taking a trip to si saves me several days of hell ill take the trip. im an elitist yes but im no fool. ,2574,2,0,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/shocker-staten-island-genius-bar-less-crowded-than-soho/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/shocker-staten-island-genius-bar-less-crowded-than-soho/,,,

quickerase 1.5 ,Nov 10 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,tips and tricks:&:freeware , its the little freeware tools that i love best about mac os x. part of my job is to make the labs at my school as easy-to-use as possible so im always looking for free software tools i can install in our lab images to assist our students in using our mac workstations. ive flagged disk utility as an andquot;adminandquot; app and so they are not allowed to launch the program which means they have no easy built-in way to erase a cd-rw. the solution wasnt to allow them to use disk utility but a great little freeware utility called quickerase 1.5.quickerase 1.5 allows users to erase a cd-rw from the finder without using  disk utility. the difference between quickerase and other freeware disk burning/erasing programs is how simple it is. it puts an icon in every finder window that a user can click on to erase a cd-rw. no rooting around in the utilities or applications folder. theres virtually no learning curve. its something that apple should have built into panthers or tigers finder but didnt. theres a version for panther and a version for tiger. give it a try.update: just a heads up because its not that clear. all you have to do to enable this as a quickbutton in the finder window icon bar is drag and drop the application icon to where on the finder icon bar you want it to live. ,1297,1,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/quickerase-1-5/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/quickerase-1-5/,,,

rokrs price cut to $149.99, apple sabotaging the market? ,Nov 10 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,hardware:&:ipod family:&:itunes , looks like someone involved with the rokr has finally done something about instead of merely talking about the phones less than stellar success by lowering its price to $149.99 - still with a two-year contract of course. i guess with all the buzz of more itunes-enabled motorola phones on their way such as the razr v3i damien posted about tuesday and the slvr l7 engadget dug up the first step had to be taken on the road to putting the rokr out to pasture.the one thing that bugs me about the officially announced razr v3i is: there doesnt seem to have been much fanfair. apple originally announced the crummy rokr yes and the nano at a surprise press event and even got ceos from cingular and motorola up on stage. but it seems like the v3i was merely announced in some far less spectacular press release just to get it out there. its looking more and more likely that apple might be trying to sabotage the very idea of a music-playing phone in the us theyre huge in other countries to keep ipod sales on the up and up. a macslash post from yesterday puts it best: since apple has the big name for music devices right now they could keep forcing phone companies to release crippled ho-hum itunes phones to steer us all to buy an ipod until any significant competition reared its head. if that day came motorola or whoever could finally have the green light to release a truly itunes-worthy phone trumping anyone who steps up to the plate with the power of their music namesake. sneaky apple. very sneaky indeed.[via ilounge] ,1529,4,0,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/rokrs-price-cut-to-149-99-apple-sabotaging-the-market/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/10/rokrs-price-cut-to-149-99-apple-sabotaging-the-market/,,

safe sleep for the rest of us ,Nov 13 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,hacks:&:tips and tricks:&:odds and ends:&:powerbook , with the latest iteration of powerbooks apple just released a new feature called safe sleep was introduced that fabienne covered a couple weeks ago. in case you missed it the short of the long of this handy new feature is that it works like the hibernate feature of windows: you can save a snapshot of what youre working on to your hard drive and completely power down the notebook - meaning you can swap out batteries and power back up to your desktop as you left it in about 10 seconds or simply store the notebook without draining any power like the regular sleep feature does.since this new feature is so handy some mac users out there were determined to claim it for the rest of us and it appears they were successful: on digg.com i found a blog entry detailing the fact that this new safe sleep feature is entirely software based - so theyve figured out how to enable it for the rest of us and have posted a tutorial. its reported this works on ibook g4s and powerbook g4s but it isnt necessarily limited to those models. as always: back up your stuff before doing this. it sounds like a fairly painless procedure though i havent tried it yet but there is never a good reason not to back your stuff up. for those of you who try this out please post your experience in our comments for the rest of the class.side note: i thought you could do something similar to this already with the 15andquot; and 17andquot; powerbooks where you could set the book to regular sleep pop out the battery and you had 90 seconds of stored power to pop a new one back in. ive seen this demonstrated but i cant find any documentation on how to do it. if anyone has info on what im talking about im sure wed all love it if you could post that too. ,1733,2,0,26, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/13/safe-sleep-for-the-rest-of-us/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/13/safe-sleep-for-the-rest-of-us/,,,

buying a mac: finding the deals ,Nov 14 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,retail:&:how-tos , everyone likes a good deal. and now youre in the market for buying a new mac. here are some tips for buying a mac at a bargain price.what to buyfirst consider exactly what you want to buy. buying a tricked-out powermac g5 tower is quite different than buying a low-end ibook. if you dont know whats currently available from apple use their online apple store to see the differences between the models. browse around and narrow down what you want. laptop? desktop? do you need a keyboard mouse or monitor? one excellent idea is to set yourself a spending cap. decide how much you can really afford to spend on a new computer and then dont allow yourself to select a mac that will cost more than you can afford. credit cards are bad mmmkay?consider buying a previous generation mac one that was just discontinued. when apple updates their product lines which happens several times a year the market is flooded with these previous generation machines often at pretty decently-discounted prices. for my bargan-hunting clients i often tell them to wait until apple refreshes their product line and then buy. you wont get the latest-and-greatest but they are still perfectly great machines and even greater because you saved quite a bit of money. several of the retailers i mention in this article offer deals during the inventory clear-out phase after an apple product refresh/release. more after the jump... ,1405,1,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/14/buying-a-mac-finding-the-deals/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/14/buying-a-mac-finding-the-deals/,,,

psp vs ipod debate continues ,Nov 14 2005 12:00AM,jan kabili,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:video:&:books and blogs , pundits just cant help comparing the video-capable ipod to the sony playstation portable. our resident expert c.k. author of the forthcoming book psp hacks commented on these comparisons last month. c.k. concluded that there is room for both the psp and the new ipod because the former is essentially a gaming system and the latter a multimedia and storage device. macworld now takes another comparative look at the two devices focusing specifically on their capabilities as portable video players. macworld author peter cohen concludes that the ipod wins in the area of portability and video distribution. he prefers slipping the ipod into a shirt pocket to toting the larger psp. he also finds apples itunes video distribution system a big plus for the ipod. on the other hand cohen deems the psp the winner when it comes to viewability. he just cant resist the psps big screen 4.3 inches as compared to the ipods 2.3 inches and long battery life. cohen compares other aspects of the two players from storage capacity the ipod shines here to computer connectivity to the ease of converting to psp or ipod friendly video formats.cohens analysis makes sense but it neglects one important considerationandndash;brand loyalty. when it comes to choosing a portable video player apple users naturally gravitate to the ipod. we just love apple products no matter how superior the psp screen or battery may be. that said if youre into gaming youre probably lusting after a psp too. ,1477,3,1,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/14/psp-vs-video-capable-ipod-debate-continues/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/14/psp-vs-video-capable-ipod-debate-continues/,,,

safetype vertical keyboard ,Nov 15 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,accessories:&:hardware:&:peripherals , so i was browsing the alternative keyboard gallery earlier today and i came across this gem by safetype. its a vertical keyboard that claims to be the ultimate in ergonomics - and they have a cornell university study to back that up! andquot;cornell university conducted extensive testing of the safetype  keyboardandtrade; and found that it greatly reduces the risk of repetitive  motion injury carpal tunnel syndrome etc.andquot;its a standard qwerty split keyboard layout so you dont have to re-learn how to type and there are even mirrors that fly out so that you can see the keys if youre not a great touch typist. although frankly if youre not a great touch-typist by now you probably dont spend enough time at the keyboard that repetitive stress injuries are a concern for you. if youre having trouble picturing how this all works check out the quicktime video on their site which is also good for a laugh.the vertical keyboard does work with macs although youll need a usb adapter for it. since there are no mac-specific drivers to worry about it should work in any os though. as for the price? these retail for about $300 - but they seem to stock a fair amount of refurbs and just-off-lease units for about half the retail price.if you have one of these or have ever used one id love to hear about it! ,1312,4,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/15/safetype-vertical-keyboard/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/15/safetype-vertical-keyboard/,,,

wheres the belkin flip kvm for mac mini? ,Nov 15 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,accessories:&:analysis / opinion:&:peripherals:&:mac mini , back in july belkin announced a product that got me very excited. that doesnt happen very often but when a product is announced that solves a vexing problem for me and does so in a stylish functional package i get stoked. the belkin flip for mac mini is everything i want it to be - on paper. unfortunately thats the only place it seems to exist for now: on paper. the flip is peripheral switch a kvm if you prefer that fully supports apple keyboards and function keys like eject and volume controls - whether youre using a mac keyboard or a pc keyboard. it sports touch-sensitive buttons and - heres the best part - its not butt-ugly! its actually designed to stack on top of or underneath your mac mini. its vga instead of dvi but thats not a deal breaker for me. the important thing is that it serves a valuable purpose and helps minimize ugly cable clutter in the process. my husband uses a mac mini along with a work-issued toshiba notebook. i rigged him up with a matias keyboard a small set of andquot;cubeandquot; speakers an iogear kvm and 19-inch lcd so that he could switch back and forth between the pc and the mac mini with the flick of a switch. that setup is taking up valuable space on our dining room table. the cables are black and ugly and too long as they are built-in to the kvm unit. and aside from the piles of mail and magazines that have also taken up permanent home on that table that setup is the first thing you see when you walk into our apartment. the belkin flip would go a long way toward solving the visual problems with this setup - if only it actually existed! ive been calling belkin periodically to find out when its expected to ship and the best answer ive gotten so far is that the product is still listed in their system as being in andquot;concept phase.andquot; that was a few weeks ago. where i come from you dont mass-mail press releases for a product thats still just a mockup. needless to say this is a real downer for me. i want this product to be real. i need this product to be real. it would look sweet with this display perched on top of it. i want to give belkin my $79.99!addendum: right before i posted this i checked belkins press release page again and it seems theyve recently updated it to say that the product is expected to ship in december. previously it said andquot;early fall 2005.andquot; perhaps my suffering will soon come to an end and ill find a belkin flip in my christmas stocking! still im tiring of this growing trend that mandates andquot;announce early ship late.andquot; ,2548,3,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/15/wheres-the-belkin-flip-kvm-for-mac-mini/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/15/wheres-the-belkin-flip-kvm-for-mac-mini/,,,

itunes music store prices to increase? ,Nov 16 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,  , from the wall street journal and betanews rumblings today about apple possibly introducing variable pricing in their itunes music store at the behest of the music industry. songs by popular artists would be more than $.99 and lesser-known artists would be priced at $.99 or lower. the music industry has been pressuring apple and steve jobs to introduce this almost since the itunes music store was launched.my opinion? this would pretty much kill the itunes music store. im already reluctant to buy music via itunes because of the included drm. if they increase the price ill stop buying downloaded music altogether and go back to buying non-drm cds. im certain im not alone in this opinion. just the other day a student in one our labs wanted to use a song she had purchased on her computer at home using itunes v6.0 for a presentation she was creating for a class project. our lab computers have itunes v4.9 on them and songs purchased in itunes 6 dont work in previous versions. if i had not been there to help her burn a cd and then re-rip it back to a non-drm mp3 she would never have been able to use the song she legally purchased for her presentation. the conversion process to get rid of the drm so she could use the song as she wanted was just too complex. she was cursing apple and the itunes store and i had to explain to her that its the large music companies forcingandnbsp; drm not apple. and now the greedy jerks are whining about profit and forcing apple to increase the prices on much of their music. ,1521,1,1,28, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/16/itunes-music-store-prices-to-increase/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/16/itunes-music-store-prices-to-increase/,,,

excellent ibook hd replacement instructions ,Nov 16 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,hardware:&:how-tos:&:tips and tricks:&:ibook , i used to do a lot of hardware repairs. i knew the wallstreet powerbook inside and out and could do a logic board swap or sound card/power plug replacment; very common in that model with my eyes closed. for awhile i was taking apart the titaniums but then my job changed and i began focusing more on the software side of things. around this time apple shipped the first of the white dual-usb ibooks. id taken apart pretty much every thing else apple had shipped for the last five years without many problems so i readily agreed to help an acquaintance upgrade the 10gb hd in his ibook to a 20gb hd. how hard could it be right? i couldnt have been more surprised at how significantly more complex was the take-apart for the dual-usb ibooks. even with the official apple take-apart manual available to certified apple hardware techs working for asaps it still took me about six hours to do the job. suffice it to say the dual-usb ibook is a tough repair. lots and lots of screws complex wire routing and a high propensity for damage to components unless youre very careful. to this day i refuse to upgrade a white dual-usb ibook. most people who want an upgrade or repair arent willing to pay me adequately for the time itd take to do the job properly and professionally. nor am i willing to revisit that headache. im more than happy to allow somone else with more patience than i to do the upgrades and repairs on these units.which leads me to what i found earlier today. a british belgian hardware wizard has documented his hd replacement and internal microphone fix on his 800hmz ibook g4. this is one of the best take-aparts ive ever seen. the pictures are great and the accompanying instructions are clear with plenty of warnings about andquot;gotchas.andquot; make special note of how he draws a screw diagram for the many ibook screws. if youre learning apple hardware take-aparts or studying for the apple hardware certifications this is one of the best tips youll learn.very well done. this one is definitely getting printed and filed in my hardware tech file. ,2069,1,0,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/16/excellent-ibook-hd-replacement-instructions/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/16/excellent-ibook-hd-replacement-instructions/,,,

ipods are for brain surgeons ,Nov 16 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,ipod family:&:education , you dont have to be a brain surgeon to own and operate an ipod but it helps that is owning an ipod helps you be a brain surgeon [grin]. the sylvius project was founded by a neuroscientist whose goal is to transform neuroscience education through the use of high-quality visual guides and glossaries. the group has recently released a sylvius visual guide for color screen ipods.what i find most intersting about this is the unique use of the ipod as a guide-viewer for a highly-specialized field. if the video ipod becomes as commonplace as the first generation ipods how long before its video format starts being used for more than just watching television shows. might the medical education field also start releasing training videos for the ipod? or perhaps well start to see video ipods used as travelogue companions. the possible uses are exciting.while it might be conventional wisdom to refer to the newton as a failure the truth of the matter is that it was way ahead of its time. people in several industries recognized the unique abilities of the newton and began to integrate it into their industries. one of those industries was the medical industry and there were many medical softwares written for the newton. my personal fairy-godmother-pipe-dream wish is for apple to release an updated newton but its probably not going to happen. however seeing the ipod evolve and watching different industries begin to use it in unique ways is encouraging. now steve how about that psp-sized mini-tablet that can pair with an ipod nano? ,1541,1,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/16/ipods-are-for-brain-surgeons/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/16/ipods-are-for-brain-surgeons/,,,

ipods with video support porn ,Nov 17 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:video , eric j. sinrod what a last name is worried. he thinks that the new ipod with video is going to make getting and transporting porn much easier for kids and workers alike. parents will have another front on which they need to fight to keep their children porn free and the ipod is much easier to hide than a magazine.he also worries that the ipods small size will make it trivial for workers to sneak pornographic movies into the workplace and watch them away from others.these are valid concerns on the surface however once you realize that the ipod has always made the transportation of porn easy any portable hard drive does then this ipod bashing is really unfounded. kids and adults are going to find away to look at naughty content with or without a video enabled ipod. when i was a kid there were no ipods nor was the internet the porn filled bastion that is now and we had no problem finding porn. not that i looked at any of it honest mom it was all my brothers.[via tech dirt] ,986,2,1,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/17/ipods-with-video-support-porn/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/17/ipods-with-video-support-porn/,,,

intel ibooks at mwsf in january 2006? ,Nov 17 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,hardware:&:rumors:&:ibook , mac rumor site thinksecret is reporting that sources close to apple have told them to expect apple to announceandnbsp; ibooks with intel processors at the macworld expo conference in january of 2006. the ibooks would be the first of apples product line to sport intel chips since their announcement in june 2005 that the company would be moving their product lines to intel processors.this actually makes a bit of sense. apple wants people to switch in big numbers and introducing an inexpensive ibook may help those people sitting on the fence decide to move to apple. if apple can price them aggressively enough intel ibooks could compete quite well with the low-end pc notebooks on the market. and since professional users tend to use powerbooks and g5 towers by moving the consumer line to intel first it gives the larger software manufacturers like adobe and macromedia time to finish rewriting their applications to run natively on the intel processors instead of emulated in rosetta. ,992,1,0,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/17/intel-ibooks-at-mwsf-in-january-2006/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/17/intel-ibooks-at-mwsf-in-january-2006/,,,

on the sony drm rootkit issue and os x security implications ,Nov 17 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,its:&:security , im certainly not a guru of the inner workings of os x nor am i a six-figure security analyst but im starting to wonder if this whole sony drm rootkit situation has become the elephant in a room filled with enthusiastic os x users and security evangelists alike. dont get me wrong: just because sony slipped one past us doesnt mean im renouncing my os but think about it: sony - a company that isnt exactly known for being that os x friendly or aware yes many of their products either work with os x or can be made to was able to sneak os x kernel extensions into the wild and one report ive seen said some of these rootkit-ridden discs are up to a year old.thats big and the ramifications could be too. what does this mean for os x security? do we need some rootkit-revealer-like apps? could this turn into a significant mar on os xs reputation for a virus and malware-free experience? i hate to bring up these questions but they beg to be explored. conversely i dont see a whole lot of chatter on the net about any of this so maybe it means the os x community just isnt that worried. i personally didnt switch to os x based solely on the selling point of security - i did it more for the superior functionality thought-out design and those killer stickers you get in the box.honestly i hope this whole situation gets written in the books as a speed bump in os xs adolescence. if there is something more serious to be discussed im sure experts and analysts far more knowledgeable than i will either get right to it or are already knee-deep in the debate. i guess only time will tell. there is one thing im sure of though: the itms doesnt have to worry about losing sales from me anytime soon. my physical cd collection disappeared a long time ago and i have no plans to the contrary. ,1785,1,0,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/17/on-the-sony-drm-rootkit-issue-and-os-x-security-implications/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/17/on-the-sony-drm-rootkit-issue-and-os-x-security-implications/,,,

8 easy steps to put internet video on your ipod ,Nov 18 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,ipod family:&:video:&:how-tos:&:internet , step 1: buy snapz pro x its $69.95 for the video-capable version; theres a 30-day demo you can try.    step 2: load the video you want to capture in google video or some such other service. queue up the video and pause it.    step 3: launch snapz pro x. click on the movie tab check andquot;use movie guidesandquot; uncheck andquot;cursor visibleandquot; and drag the little window selection tool until it fits the video you want to capture. make sure you check the andquot;mac audio trackandquot; box. if the video is under 480x480 then youre good. if not then change the scale options to make it less than 480x480.    step 4: double-click the screen to start recording then quickly hit that play button hopefully everything has buffered by now.    step 5: keep capturing until the video is finished playing. keep in mind that you cannot open new windows during this process if they will block what you are capturing. you also want to make sure than any other programs like ichat that emit noises are turned off to prevent that audio from showing up in your capture.        step 6: once the video finishes playing hit whatever key combo youve chosen for snapz pro to stop the capture. another window will open offering to save or delete the capture. make sure youve installed 3ivx. change the video settings to 3ivx medium quality best depth and the audio to ima 4:1 44.1khz stereo 16 bit.         step 7: wait for the file to export fully. open the resulting .mov file in quicktime pro and export to ipod or use one of the other video to ipod conversion utilities to do the same thing.        step 8: drag the resulting video file over to your ipod. enjoy!        *note: this will actually work for any video file or dvd not just with internet files. for example one could buy a tv show off the itms and then use this to circumvent that silly silly drm. also if you tweak step 7 nicely with the proper mpeg4 settings you could skip step 8 but that wouldnt be easy so i didnt try it for this post. ,2000,3,1,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/18/8-easy-steps-to-put-internet-video-on-your-ipod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/18/8-easy-steps-to-put-internet-video-on-your-ipod/,,
joels take on itunes variable pricing ,Nov 18 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:its:&:retail:&:blogging , joel spolsky is usually right on target with his commentary and his piece today on the possibility of itunes variable pricing is spot on.andnbsp; nail head hit. seriously hes right on this one. the bottom line is this: variable pricing has nothing to do with actual demand. it has to do with perceived value. we used to play this trick when i worked at blockbuster all the time. if you go to andquot;the wallandquot; of new releases youll see one or two copies of say andquot;spunandquot; but there are probably hundreds of copies of andquot;pop star.andquot; when the average merican browses through hes likely to assume that with all those copies the movies got to be good. same thing happens with generic food if its cheaper how can it be just as good as the more expensive brand name? the music companies want to create a perceived value of junk like the britneys and downplay the goodness of less mainstream fare. joel begins with a very good analogy based on movie theater distribution and sales which truly illustrates this point. my suggestion? dont mess with a good thing. would you rather pay less for less popular music at the risk of diminishing returns for lesser-known artists or do you think $.99 is the way it should always be? ,1245,7,0,16, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/18/joels-take-on-itunes-variable-pricing/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/18/joels-take-on-itunes-variable-pricing/,,

shipping a flat-panel imac ,Nov 18 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,how-tos:&:imac , tuaw reader alex hutton has just sold his flat-panel imac but does not have the original box to ship it in and is asking if we have any advice on how to pack this uniquely-shaped imac to minimize the chance of it being damaged during shipping.the best advice i can give alex is to pack it in a box significantly larger than the imac and use styrofoam andquot;peanutsandquot; packed tightly into the box. the peanuts will form around the imac and hold it in place. i would also cut pieces of egg-carton foam and line the each of the sides of the box before putting in the imac and filling with peanuts. cover the display with something like felt or an old pillowcase.another option is to visit a decent-sized professional shipping company where theyll have a andquot;foam-in-placeandquot; system that can mold foam around any unusual-shaped object. however this might be prohibitively expensive given the size of the shipping box youll need to send a flat-panel imac.you might also just consider selling your flat-panel imac locally and avoid the hassle of shipping altogether. craigslist has worked wonders for me in selling used macs locally.do our readers have any other suggestions on packing and shipping a flat-panel imac? ,1229,2,0,21, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/18/shipping-a-flat-panel-imac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/18/shipping-a-flat-panel-imac/,,,

30 million ipods--ipods are everywhere ,Nov 22 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,ipod family:&:apple financial , apple announced today that it has shipped more than 30 million ipods since the mp3 players debut in october of 2001.i can remember showing my family my 1st-generation ipod during our annual holiday get-together in 2001. they didnt know what an ipod was or even what an mp3 was. none of them i think really grasped that it was just the beginning of the now enormous portable mp3 player market. what was striking to me is that i could hand my ipod to my mother who sometimes calls me to ask me how to print and within a minute or two she intuitively understood how to navigate through the music on the ipod.about two years ago i started seeing ipods everywhere. i couldnt ride the subway in nyc without seeing the tell-tale white earbuds. this trend has only escalated recently and shows little sign of slowing down. apple continues to release new and better ipods with new functionality and has recently secured enough flash memory storage for the next five years. ipods are even being spoofed on saturday night live.now four years later you can guess what both my teenaged neice and nephew want for christmas. ,1111,3,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/22/30-million-ipods-ipods-are-everywhere/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/22/30-million-ipods-ipods-are-everywhere/,,,

navio to challenge fairplay drm ,Nov 23 2005 12:00AM,jan kabili,ipod family:&:its:&:apple , navio a company specializing in drm is busy reverse-engineering apples fairplay drm to enable music providers other than apple to sell drm-encoded downloads that can be played on ipods. this move would be a boon to other online retailers who want to take advantage of the popularity of ipods.realnetworks employed a similar strategy in 2004 allowing consumers to use its harmony technology to buy songs from sites other than the itunes music store and play them on ipods. apple didnt like that at all likening realnetworks tactics and ethics to those of a hacker trying to break into the ipod. apple countered with an ipod software update that tried to prevent realnetworks downloads from playing on ipods. realnetworks got around that attempt with its own update that apparently still works.navios chief operating officer ray schaaf recently told playlist that andquot;with respect to fairplay right now apple doesnt license that so we take the view that as realnetworks allows users to buy fairplay songs on rhapsody we would take the same approach.andquot; schaaf didnt specify which content providers his company plans to work with saying only that: andquot;we are working with a number of studios a number of [music] labels and we are working with [cell] carriers.andquot;apple hasnt responded as yet. it could send in the lawyers and/or tweak its software again to try to foil navios break-in but it looks like challengers will continue to pop up. what outcome do you predict? ,1484,5,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/23/navio-plans-to-break-fairplay-drm/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/23/navio-plans-to-break-fairplay-drm/,,,

ten things to do for moms mac this thanksgiving ,Nov 23 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,hardware:&:software:&:how-tos:&:odds and ends:&:freeware:&:open source , since youll no doubt be freeloading on moms yummy thanksgiving meal tomorrow its only right that you should fix her computer right? download squad has posted up full instructions for the pc folks and i thought id chime in with the mac side of the force. so while everyone is sitting on the couch staring at the tv you can squirrel yourself away in the computer nook getting the family mac in tip-top shape and be quite the hero.first if she doesnt have one buy her a mac. my suggestion is an imac because its just the right blend of computer entertainment center and communications device. it also looks might cool and comes with almost everything shell need inside. also the likelihood of having to fix it next year will be pretty slim as opposed to that 1999 vintage dell shes been using.backup time! there are a lot of ways to do this. if she has a .mac account id say use backup.app judiciously. i set up my wifes ibook to back up her keychain and settings nightly mail messages and critical docs weekly and all home files monthly. theres also carbon copy cloner which allows you to make a total copy of her hard drive. just make sure you have another drive handy a big old external firewire drive is best. and apple has some great tips and techniques for backup as well though they require some heavy lifting in some cases.about everyone i know uses cocktail on a regular basis to do stuff that makes your mac happy. sure its a gui front-end for the *nix commands you could do in terminal... but i dont think mom cares for all that cli business. set it up using the pilot portion of the app to quietly optimize the mac on a regular basis.defrag her drive. ha just kidding. since panther os x has included a sort of on-the-fly defrag utility that runs silently in the background when needed. its not optimal for large defrags or huge files but unless moms working on cutting a major motion picture i doubt thats an issue. ok if you really want to defrag or just run some pretty extensive diagnostics theres always the excellent app techtool from micromat. in fact if the mac purchased at any point had applecare but the os had been upgraded to tiger you should not use the andquot;freeandquot; version of techtool that comes with applecare. that is if the version of techtool youre using isnt the most up-to-date you could actually fry the machine...install anti-virus software. clamxav is free and quite excellent in this regard. sure you could roll your eyes when the subject of virii comes up but i find its better to install peace of mind than give a piece of mind.make her safari experience better by installing saft. if you need to sell her on it brush up on c.k.s glowing endorsement.run all those updates shes been putting off. then backup again if youre going chronologically once youre sure everything is working fine. why not backup after updates? lets just say ive had bad things happen in the past. also ive noticed apple tends to roll out updates about an hour before the tech support crew goes home for the weekend...use allumes spring cleaning to clear out unused apps file duplicates and setup a file restoration scheme. spring cleaning automates what can be a tedious process though almost everything it does can be done manually.run disk utility. make sure s.m.a.r.t. status is verified if not get  that machine to a shop fast the drive is going to fail soon. run the  permissions repairs. lather rinse repeat.  remember to keep it simple. as easy as the mac is to use theres a lot of andquot;stuffandquot; you can do with it. things like quicksilver growl and such are great for power users but you have to ease into them as an average user. making things andquot;just workandquot; is pretty good for most. oh and you can always make sure her rss screen saver is set to tuaw so she can start becoming a power user! ,3840,17,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/23/ten-things-to-do-for-moms-mac-this-thanksgiving/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/23/ten-things-to-do-for-moms-mac-this-thanksgiving/,,

potential dashboard widget install/security bug? ,Nov 27 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,os:&:widgets , while installing the pageopener widget i just mentioned i noticed something odd that could possibly be a bug in the widget installation process. i by no means am trying to incite mass hysteria centered around widget security consider this more food for thought: im using the latest version of safari on os x 10.4.3 and i have the browsers auto-install option enabled. once safari downloaded and unarchived the widget it gave me a pre-dashboard dialog asking if i want to install the widget; naturally i chose andquot;installandquot;. now dashboard kicks in enables the widget and gives me a second dialog pictured inside dashboard asking whether i want to delete or keep the widget. before making a choice i left dashboard to check on something only to come back into dashboard to find the keep/delete dialog no longer there; the widget was simply enabled and waiting to do my bidding.now i am neither a security expert nor an os x bug-tracking sleuth but isnt this a little odd? a fellow tuaw blogger scott mcnulty thought this could be chalked up to a usability thing as if andquot;keepandquot; was simply a default option in the dialog that dashboard choses on exit. but if thats the case there isnt any feedback in said dialog that one option is a default over another or if one option is being chosen; no mouse-over no aqua-highlight color no flash or blink once an option is chosen. even if this isnt quite a security issue its at least a shining example of where some aspects of apples ui have recently strayed quite far from the aqua path.on the note of security however i know widgets - their capabilities and potential threat - have been discussed quite a lot but could this odd behavior be a new way that dashboard is leaving the front door just a little too open? as far as i know we havent seen anything truly malicious appear in the months since tigers unleashing so hopefully this is nothing more than a quirk and you can all go on about your business. ,1969,3,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/27/potential-dashboard-widget-install-security-bug/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/27/potential-dashboard-widget-install-security-bug/,,,
widget watch: page opener ,Nov 27 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,cool tools:&:internet tools:&:bad apple:&:widgets , i think ive just found a slick widget for all you web developers out there: pageopener. this widget allows you to open any file or url simultaneously in any or all of your installed browsers. great for testing purposes and it works really well but theres one catch that took me a little while to figure out: on the back of the widget is where you can drag and drop your browsers in order for them to be included in the widget. theres a list of browsers on the back and text that says andquot;to add a browser drag the application here.andquot; you need to drag the application onto that text not the list of browsers. its a little counter-intuitive given that most other os x apps with lists like this allow you to drop items directly into the list. however ill let this quirk slide since its a widget and widgets most certainly can be quirky.just in case this widgets developer is listening i have one feature request: dumping browser caches. safari and others are notoriously horrible with caching while testing sites and itd be great to have a simple way to dump across multiple browsers while using a tool like this. ,1122,1,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/27/widget-watch-page-opener/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/27/widget-watch-page-opener/,,,

apple broadband tuner v1.0 ,Nov 28 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,tips and tricks:&:software update , the idea of changing some networking settings in mac os x to get better speed from your broadband connection has been around for quite awhile. ive used the donationware broadband optimizer on every version of mac os x since jaguar and its definitely increased my broadband speeds particuarly on my lan. now apple has jumped on board and is offering a package that provides the same similar functionality. apples broadband tuner v1.0 is available for download from their downloads page. apples version requires mac os x 10.4 or later.thanks to tim o. for the tip on apples release of this software.update: further reading the comments at macrumors.com make it seem that this software is helpful primarily to satellite broadband users rather than cable or dsl users. its for people with high-latency broadband and most cable and dsl lines are very low-latency. im not entirely sure why my lan speeds increased consistently after using the donationware broadband optimizer. as always your mileage may vary. ,1005,4,0,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/28/apple-broadband-tuner-v1-0/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/28/apple-broadband-tuner-v1-0/,,,

popmac ,Nov 28 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,software update:&:tuaw business , the guys behind app4mac.com--makers of wkiosk kidsbrowser and distributors of mellel--are set to release a new venture called popmac dvd. it looks to be a monthly ? dvd release containing popular freeware demoware and the large mac os x updates. aimed almost exclusively at people without a broadband connection popmac looks to be an interesting venture if a bit expensive.however ive been under the impression for quite some time that apple does not legally allow entities other than apple to distribute mac os x updates. its one of the reasons macaddict doesnt release cds anymore with their magazine correct me if im wrong here; i havent seen a macaddict magazine in about two years. it also makes sense from apples perspective. if anyone can release their updates via a distribution mechanism other than software update whats to stop someone from modifying an updater to include spyware adware malware viruses or other nefarious modifications. i kinda doubt popmac was able to score a license from apple to distribute their os updates so im left wondering exactly how legitimate this venture is. its not a bad idea of course im just wary. what do you think? do any readers know precisely what apples policy is on the redistribution of mac os x and bundled software updates?[via hardmac] ,1292,3,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/28/popmac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/28/popmac/,,,

showing off a mac mini media center ,Dec 5 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:peripherals:&:odds and ends:&:mac mini , this weekend i had some time to kill before going to catch a movie so i dropped by a friends house to show him some videos which were all funny movies off the net stuff like wonder showzen and that one of chris pirillo talking about eating his nuts. unfortunately i had left the dvd burns of these vids at work. burning more wasnt an option because i discovered this less than an hour before leaving. what to do? well i wrapped up my mac mini the av adapter for output to a tv a mini-plug to stereo rca cable an old blueberry puck mouse from my ancient g3 tower and took them on the road in my laptop case. setup took about 5 minutes and the reaction was priceless.first my friend and his fiancandeacute; had never glimpsed a mac mini. they were impressed. andquot;thats a computer?andquot; i had taken the form factor for granted. when i plugged the system into his massive but old standard-def big-screen tv it looked beautiful. ive used the mini on a tv before but nothing over 30 inches. this was over 4 feet diagonally and the menus were legible the dock looked greatandmdash; just wonderful. the only problem: no remote. my friendandnbsp; asked me if they made a remote. instead of launching into a typical mac fanboy rant about ati this imac that i just said yes and let his imagination wander. without a keyboard i wasnt able to enter fullscreen mode in vlc but nonetheless the videos looked great. even wmvs with atrocious blockiness looked nice given the downsampling of the signal.so my point: a mac mini media center will be a hit and i know at least two people who now want one. the total cost of this rig was less than $600! if you ever have the chance i highly recommend turning a mini into a sort of video jukebox. next time ill be sure to install frontrow or something like it and really show them some mac style. has anyone else had a chance to rock the house like this? ,1890,6,4,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/05/showing-off-a-mac-mini-media-center/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/05/showing-off-a-mac-mini-media-center/,,

podkey sez: we didnt hijack a podcast ,Dec 7 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:podcasting , following up from an earlier story file this in the andquot;possibly setting the record straightandquot; department. the owner of podkey previously referred to as podkeyword refutes claims hes a crook. after seeing the specific request made by vegan podcaster erik marcus im inclined to agree. what erik asked george lambert ownder of podkey to do wasnt just remove the offending url. he wanted lambert to remove the url and any keywords necessary from any existing opml... which quite frankly is a bit unreasonable. once that gets picked up george cant very well control it can he? unfortunately the damage is done and now it might not have even been podkey that andquot;hijackedandquot; the feed to begin with. it might have been the webmaster of vegan.com or erik himself that registered the offending keywords and url with podkey in the first place. but in the process of removing the original mistaken feed link and keywords podkeys owner lambert cant check to see where that original request came from. apparently all this was revealed on david lawrences show and is further illuminated on podkeys blog.long story short were still looking at a flaw in the system. if someone had maliciously pointed to an incorrect url how do you fix that? podkey is on the hook but to fix it does require special coding and extra effort. so if its all true and its all some big misunderstanding i for one apologize profusely for calling podkey such nasty names. i dont tolerate thieves and the evidence certainly wasnt in podkeys favor to begin with but after seeing all the evidence sans court prodceedings anyway im inclined to agree with podkeys assertion: andquot;seems like there wasnt malicious intent more of a communication confusion. but there is a real problem with rss feeds because anyone can make one and point to your content which messes up your control and tracking as well as the fact that if the cached version goes down your subscribers dont get your content.andquot; i guess its back to the old innocent until proven guilty schtick eh? ,2047,3,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/07/podkey-sez-we-didnt-hijack-a-podcast/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/07/podkey-sez-we-didnt-hijack-a-podcast/,,

ibm didnt want to mobilize the g5 ,Dec 8 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,hardware:&:odds and ends:&:apple , first there were endless rumors that apple was switching to intel. once the bomb dropped there was speculation the switch was due to ibms inability to cram a g5 into a 1andquot; powerbook.andnbsp; now a cnet interview with michel mayer ceo of freescale the motorola spinoff who owns the powerpc architecture puts all the speculation to rest with a couple of simple sentences: andquot;[the g5] worked pretty well. and then ibm decided not to take the g5 into the laptop and decided to really focus its chip business on the game consoles.andquot; there we have it. the powerpc was eliminated from apples playbook not with a bang or a whimper but with a simple decision. oddly enough mayer also elaborates in the interview that jobs wanted to make the switch about five years ago but the g5 is what sold him into sticking with the powerpc. oh the tales these companies weave.on an unrelated the note the interview is a pretty interesting look at some of the other places the powerpc is and will be used including more consumer electronics gaming systems xbox 360 anyone? and even air bag deployment in the cars we drive. kinda funny to think that similar processors both save your life and allow you to not have to run windows hey?[via digg] ,1240,4,1,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/08/ibm-didnt-want-to-mobilize-the-g5/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/08/ibm-didnt-want-to-mobilize-the-g5/,,,

tip: getting back to where you left off in itunes ,Dec 9 2005 12:00AM,jan kabili,tips and tricks:&:itunes , this may be old hat to those of you who spend every waking minute in itunes but for the rest of you heres a useful tip i picked up from maccasts latest podcast. lets say youre listening to your favorite tune and you hit pause so you can listen to another track or take care of some other business. you can get right back to the spot where you left off if youve done a little prep work to activate bookmarking in that tune. ctrl-click the tune in your itunes library and choose get info from the contextual menu. click the options tab in the window that opens put a checkmark next to remember playback position and click ok. from now on whenever you pause that song hitting play will take you back to the point at which you paused rather than to the beginning of the song. this works great on the songs on which ive tried it but it gets tedious doing this track by track. has anybody figured out a way to batch-process multiple tracks so theyll all work this way? by the way bookmarking seems to be automatic in itunes 6 for mp3 podcasts but not for all audio files. ,1067,1,2,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/09/tip-getting-back-to-where-you-left-off-in-itunes/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/09/tip-getting-back-to-where-you-left-off-in-itunes/,,,

zdnet blog thinks macintels will drop firewire ,Dec 9 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:ibook:&:powerbook , macrumors reported on a zdnet post yesterday that thinks the macintel ibooks whenever they arrive will drop firewire support altogether. the posts author jason d. ogrady also says that a little bird told him that powerbooks are going to drop fw400 but retain fw800 as andquot;a concessionandquot; to video professionals.now i am neither a high-paid industry analyst nor do i have little birds whispering in my ear but to a lowly video student and apple enthusiast such as myself this sounds like a rumor that went just a tad over the top. jason cites the lack of firewire support on the latest ipods to spark off his post but i think that decision was based on factors very irrelevant to firewire and its intended uses. firewire is a fantastic protocol meant for more intense operations like video editing throughput and os booting - two significant things that usb is all but useless at. ibooks may be apples andquot;low endandquot; portable line i use quotes because they still rock the house but there are plenty of video editors cranking out great work with them. lets also not forget that the rest of the pc industry as of late has finally caught up to firewire; it seems nearly ubiquitous on most of their hardware now.i guess at the end of the day i really hope jason missed the mark or that the bird whispering in his ear simply needs to lay off the sauce. firewire has a number of essential uses and its a necessary standard in a lot of industries - just not with certain white music players that transfer a few songs from time to time. enough with my rant though what do you guys think: would or should apple truly ditch their beloved firewire? ,1656,2,0,37, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/09/zdnet-blog-thinks-macintels-will-drop-firewire/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/09/zdnet-blog-thinks-macintels-will-drop-firewire/,,,

top x keyboard shortcuts in os x ,Dec 11 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,os:&:software:&:productivity:&:tips and tricks , its a slow weekend here at tuaw so i figured id post a tip on keyboard shortcuts ive been meaning to get to for a little while here. as ive mentioned in previous posts im a nut for keyboard shortcuts. theyre a proven way to get work done faster which means i get to cut back on buying advil in bulk. so what better way to post handy time-saving keyboard shortcuts than with a top x list?i searched through our archives while putting this list together to try and find shortcuts that either havent been mentioned before or theyre fundamental favorites that everyone could use a reminder on. while some of these shortcuts might work in various applications im specifically targeting os x key commands here. last but not least: im also trying to list shortcuts everyone can enjoy from the elite os x ninja to those who are reading this on their first mac which they pulled out of the box just yesterday. so without further adieu here are my top x keyboard shortcuts for os x in no particular order:cmd + k - transmit is my favorite ftp app but for quick and easy ftp stuff cmd + k is os xs built-in andquot;connect to serverandquot; command found under the go menu in the finder. not nearly as feature-packed as most apps but its fine for any basic work.cmd + opt + i - most of us know about cmd + i which is the get info command but if you throw opt into the mix you now have a window widely known yet undocumented as andquot;super get info.andquot; this handy window is basically a live get info window changing with each file and folder you click on enabling you to view and alter many file and folder stats such as spotlight comments and what apps open what files with one single window.cmd + opt + h - hide others. cmd + h is great for hiding the app youre in but hide others does just what it says - it hides every other app you arent in. great for cleaning up a cluttered view.cmd + shift + 3/4 - the infamous screen capture keys. using 3 allow you to capture the entire screen to a pdf panther or a png tiger on your desktop while using 4 will give you an all-too-handy aimer to drag out an exact capture area. for bonus points: after the cmd + shift + 4 combo is triggered you can then hit space bar for the option of capturing whatever window the mouse is hovered over. no dragging required.cmd + w - yes i know this ones pretty obvious to some but its a great shortcut for new os x users and a fundamental shortcut across all of os x and the apps that run on it. nearly every application not just finder windows obey the cmd + w command making it easy to get almost any window out of your way quickly.this ones a three-punch combo: 1 cmd + opt + ejectandnbsp; 2 cmd + ctrl + eject and 3 cmd + opt + ctrl + eject. what do these weird and undocumented shortcuts do you ask? well in order they sleep restart and shutdown your mac of course. each of those combinations will force their respective function unless you have open files that have yet to be saved.cmd + opt + d - show/hide the dock. a great way to free up some extra room in that screen real estate-hungry app youre running.cmd + [ and ] - forward and back in not only the finder but safari and now firefox as well. im sure there are more apps that obey this as its a handy way to move through a lot of web research or folder digging.cmd + shift + ? - yes another basic one but even you os x ninjas must admit to cracking a help file or two every now and then. this is another handy shortcut as its universal among os x and most of its apps.cmd + opt + esc - not to be left out i had to mention the last-resort shortcut for misbehaving applications. for new os x users this is a shortcut for the force quit menu a sibling to ctrl - alt - delete. for the few times i need it this is a handy shortcut as its obtainable with only one hand.  so there you have it. i hope at least a few of these can bring some joy to your workflow.andnbsp; feel free to discuss and add your own shortcuts in the comments just make sure they meet the requirement of working in os x. ,4028,2,15,39, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/11/top-x-keyboard-shortcuts-in-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/11/top-x-keyboard-shortcuts-in-os-x/,,,

review: owcs ipod battery replacement program ,Dec 18 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,ipod family:&:reviews , this week i sent the sos pink ipod mini away to otherworld computing to get a battery transplant. i decided to pay to have them do it as ive had zero spare time this week to do it myself and there was some considerable pressure to andquot;fixandquot; her ipod. im sure some of you can relate.if you choose for them to replace the battery for you they send you a box with the battery tool and pre-filled fedex form. you pack the ipod battery and tool back into the box fill out the missing portion of the fedex form slap it on and away it goes. the only confusing part is that their order form doesnt really tell you that they are going to send the box battery tool and form so youre a bit in limbo until the thing shows up and then it makes sense. i know this is how most repairs like this is done apple does it this way for some repairs for instance; i guess i was expecting to send them the ipod first. well regardless the end result is that im out of the doghouse because the so has her pink ipod mini back with a functional battery.up next week is replacing the battery in my own silver ipod mini. this time around ill use sonnets battery replacement to see how it compares. ill be installing it myself and i mess it up itll be a great excuse to buy that ipod video ive been lusting after.would i recommend owcs batteries and replacement program? yes without reservation. it was fast easy and professionally done and is a great way to breath some new life into your ipod. ,1477,2,4,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/18/review-owcs-ipod-battery-replacement-program/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/18/review-owcs-ipod-battery-replacement-program/,,,
on os xand#039;s background maintenance tasks ,Dec 19 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,os:&:productivity:&:tips and tricks:&:odds and ends , ive always  heard about these andquot;background maintenance tasksandquot; that os x performs in its omniscient glory but i never knew  much about what they actually were or when they were performed. this weekend i finally did some digging and thought id  post a few thoughts that might help give some mac users insight into maintaining os x beyond simple permissions repairs  and emptying the trash.in short os x is designed to periodically run various maintenance tasks such as  purging log files and dumping hidden and temporary files. the only problem is that these tasks by default are scheduled  to run early in the morning when id bet most mac users are sleeping. this odd task scheduling is a throwback to the  days when computers were never shut off even though a lot of computer users either shut their machines down or at  least set them to sleep at the end of the day - especially notebook users.so how can os x still run these  maintenance tasks and keep your mac running squeaky clean you ask? well you have a few options:like a  friend of mine you could simply set your mac to always be up and running optionally sleeping itself after the  maintenance task schedule specified in this apple  knowledgebase article. this certainly isnt an ideal solution if you own a portable and leave it in a bag often  overnight. you could use the simple terminal instructions in this apple knowledgebase article to run the tasks  whenever you please. os xs built-in schedule be damned!if youre on tiger you could use the maintenance automator action  which we here at tuaw love to run os xs built in maintenance tasks as well as a few extras such as permissions  repairing and preference file verifying.these are hopefully a few simple and easy-to-implement options that  will help keep your mac running like brand new. ,1821,1,6,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/19/on-os-xs-background-maintenance-tasks/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/19/on-os-xs-background-maintenance-tasks/,,,

helix updated for os x ,Dec 20 2005 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,enterprise:&:software , its  been a long time coming but helix 6 is finally available. that means a complete  switch to helix for os x is finally possible. that also means no server running on os x clients running in classic. for  those who dont know helix is a powerful database appandmdash; similar to filemaker. the core tool helix rade is a  visual tool for programming relational databases and creating apps built on those databases. while helix isnt as  slick as filemaker and nowhere near the marketing budget it does have a loyal following. its had plenty of time to  develop a following since it was introduced in 1983. but helixs fanbase isnt necessarily old its practical. helix  uses an interesting workflow and is reportedly quite easy to setup and manage. according to the site they are also  working on windows and linux versions of helix. ,832,1,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/20/helix-updated-for-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/20/helix-updated-for-os-x/,,

my spin on 10 apps every new mac user should download ,Dec 20 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,software , i normally wouldnt post this because i  dont tend to agree with the list but the digg kids are all piling on top of it so i thought i should share here:  its a list of 10 apps  every new mac user should download.    heres my take on the list:  adiumx is nice but ill stick  with ichat. i like ichat. if i need to use all those other protocols maybe ill launch fire.  cyberduck rocks. i like it. *but* ive been using fugu recently. it rocks better and harder.  safari is a  better browsing experience on os x than firefox. firefox is great and all but it doesnt integrate nicely with all the  os x goodness like the built in dictionary and spellcheck not to mention services. until it can do that nicely safari  wins especially if you load up saft.  ibackup.... eh.  ill  stick with carbon copy cloner and superduper thanks.  nvu... uh no. this is not something  that every new mac user should download. there are lots of people not coding websites who dont need this  one.  quicksilver rocks but i find if you get used to spotlight and dont mind the slight delay you dont use  it as much.  stuffit expander? i mean you need it but isnt it already on the system when you buy  it?  textwrangler is nice but ill have to say they should have mentioned subethaedit.  vlc is  good.  windows media player?! why is this on a top ten?  thats my take on it. head on over and have a  gander for yourself.

good compression settings for ipod videos ,Dec 21 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,ipod family:&:video:&:tips and tricks , ive  been tinkering with compression settings on videos trying to find the best balance of size quality compression  settings and compatibility for my video-capable ipod ever since the beginning of november.  h.264 is very nice and cool but it takes forever and a day to compress using quicktime pros export to ipod option.  since im not really interested in projecting my videos in large on the wall via an hd-capable projector theres no  need to pick it over mpeg-4. also i want to make sure that my videos especially ones like the video podcasts we do  here at tuaw are viewable by as many people as possible. so the best option is to wrap it in a .mov wrapper. that way  anyone with quicktime should be able to watch the file.so in order to do this nicely i first installed 3ivx as the codec to use. ive been meaning to try the new divx codec but havent had a chance yet. i open the file i  want to convert in quicktime pro and choose export to movie and hit the options button. this will bring up a movie  settings panel like the one pictured with this post:  choose settings... and pick the 3ivx d4 4.5.1 codec set  the quality to medium the frame rate to 24 and bitrate to 400 kbits/sec.  then adjust the size. if you have a  740x480 video file then shrink it down to 360x240.  set the sound to aac 44.100 khz stereo at  160kbps.  if you are hosting the file online check the prepare for internet streaming box and select fast  start.    thats it. the resulting file will be reasonably sized and playable in a browser on your ipod or on  any quicktime compatible system. ,1579,0,34,16, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/21/good-compression-settings-for-ipod-videos/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/21/good-compression-settings-for-ipod-videos/,,

macupdate gets a new look ,Dec 22 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:software:&:productivity , ive known joel  mueller of macupdate.com for a really long time. my brother and i used to attend  the traverse city mi-based macintosh users group cherrymug meetings back in  the mid-90s which is where we first met joel. hes a bright talented programmer and just a really nice guy and i  knew hed succeed in whatever he chose to do. but its not my personal acquaintanceship with joel that keeps me coming  back to macupdate. for years i was a versiontracker addict. i checked their software listings many times every day.  but then they were bought out by the techtracker network and the site changed. the design quality went down even now i  think its clunky and and i began to resent the enforced andquot;wait-timeandquot; when clicking on the download links.  then macfixit.com joined the techtracker network and started locking most of their content behind a subscription fee. i  was worried that versiontracker would follow suit but they wisely kept their software listings free though introduced a  andquot;professionalandquot; membership you could pay for to get extra features. meanwhile joel continued to improve  macupdate.com and it soon became my default destination for finding macintosh software downloads. even now years  later i still feel macupdate is better than versiontracker. every now and then ill go back to vt to read a user  comment which solves a particular problem but most of my downloading is done via macupdate.seems joel has  been busy updating some of the design behind different sections of macupdate. the front-page hasnt changed but  individual pages are markedly different. a programs screenshot if available has moved up from the bottom of each  page and the star rating system has nice big stars to better draw attention to the rating system. joel has jumped on  the andquot;rounded cornersandquot; bandwagon not necessarily a bad thing and each software entry is rendered in an  attractive two-paned box with rounded corners. the text is rendered in a larger font a good thing and its overall  more readable.overall these are some nice changes. congratulations joel and keep up the excellent work! ,2138,2,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/22/macupdate-gets-a-new-look/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/22/macupdate-gets-a-new-look/,,,

shortcut roundup: netnewswire ,Dec 22 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:tips and tricks:&:internet tools , ive said it before and ill say it again: im a nut for getting things done quicker through the beauty of  keyboard shortcuts. im also a nut for netnewswire and after a  week of giving a few online newsreaders like bloglines and google reader an honest try i have to come back home to my  comfortable productive plugin-able and del.icio.us-friendly  netnewswire. why you ask? well to put it simply: its those gosh darn productively intoxicating keyboard  shortcuts.since i find these shortcuts so handy and since you have to dig for some of them i figured id  share my favorites in case anyone was wondering how to leverage the power of nnw. these shortcuts are based off a  couple of assumptions: 1 youre using the regular netnewswire not the lite version; ive never used lite so i dont  know what shortcuts and functionality are present and 2 you have at least a group folder or two of feeds instead of  just one big flat list:    tab - shifts selection/focus from the feeds list to headlines to articles  themselves. handy for invoking other shortcuts.    space bar - scrolls the present article then selects the  next unread article not just the next one in the list    k - marks all articles in a feed or group as read.  oddly the shortcut for this action under the news menu is cmd   k    u - mark as unread. while k can mark an  entire group as read u will not perform the opposite on an entire group; only an individual headline. not sure  why.    d - delete read items from a group. handy for customized housecleaning if you have a boatload of  subscriptions i have 252 and set the preference to hold on to articles.    b or right arrow - open in  browser. again under the news menu this option is cmd   b. again not sure why.    . the period key - when  a group is selected this will expand the group     the comma key - collapsing a group     the  apostrophe - expands all groups    ; semicolon - you should be able to figure out this one    a  and z - when the focus is on the subscription list these select the previous and next subscriptions  respectivelynow you have a few more shortcuts to help breeze through your mounting pile of news  subscriptions. if any nnw ninjas out there want to toss in their thoughts on handy shortcuts fire away in the  comments. ,2274,2,6,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/22/shortcut-roundup-netnewswire/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/22/shortcut-roundup-netnewswire/,,,

ipod with video delights and isolates ,Dec 22 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,ipod family:&:its:&:video , david  carr was skeptical  of the viewing experience offered by the new ipod with video. he didnt think that he would enjoy watching anything  on such a small screen let alone a tv show. his 45 minute commute however has shown him the error of his ways. each  lost episode takes up about 44 minutes of time which almost covers his commute entirely. instead of having to pretend  not to listen to someone elses conversation carr is whisked away to a strange island and ponders the meanings of wacky  symbols.carr has bought into the ipod hook line and sinker but part of me thinks that cocooning ourselves  into little private spaces defined by our ipods in very public spaces cant be a good thing. i can easily imagine a day  when everyone on the train will be focused on a small screen with earbuds blocking out the noise and totally blocking  out the environment around them. or would that be a good thing? ,910,0,1,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/22/ipod-with-video-delights-and-isolates/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/22/ipod-with-video-delights-and-isolates/,,,

macs arenand#039;t going anywhere ,Dec 23 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:rumors:&:software , there are a number of articles cropping up lately  proposing that due to the success of the ipod apple will move away from producing macs in 06 and either release os x  truly into the wild or simply shelve it to collect dust through the ages.first off i refuse to link to any  of these preposterous articles as there is no way i am directly contributing to their ad impressions. second its the  holidays so im going to try and be nice: i couldnt think of a more ridiculous unfounded or illogical thing to say  about apple at a time like this yea thats me being *nice*. yes the ipod is wildly successful. woohoo.  while macs dont make nearly as big news as ipods nor do they look half as cool dangling from someones neck the macs market share in the us is up to  6.6% - almost double what i heard it was a couple of years ago. sure 6.6% is pocket change to the rest of the  industry but that has to be big big bucks in apples pockets. further with apple promising a full transition to  intel-based macs over the next two years theres even less of a possibility that any of this andquot;macs are  disappearingandquot; silliness could make a shred of sense.so please rational tuaw readers: dont fire up  your google searches for andquot;macs are disappearingandquot; and dont click on those rss headlines. sit back relax  over the holidays and relish in the fact that our favorite computer maker is finally enjoying some much-deserved  success. ,1443,0,8,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/23/macs-arent-going-anywhere/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/23/macs-arent-going-anywhere/,,,

fix for .mac sync errors with mail and random signatures ,Dec 24 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,os:&:software:&:odds and ends:&:internet tools:&:troubleshooting , i recently set mail  on both of my macs to chose a random signature. from time to time during a .mac sync ill receive an obnoxious sync  error claiming that a default signature on one mac is conflicting with the other. no matter which signature i choose  to resolve the conflict the sync process will lock into a loop repeatedly offering me a sync error with new choices  on either end for resolving the conflict. obviously this has lead to an increase of advil in my regular diet.if youre nodding your head right now youll be happy to know we all can cut back on the pain killers. for the first  time in a while i actually received a helpful message from apples email support that said something more than  andquot;try rebooting.andquot; turns out that unfortunately if you enable mails random signature feature on one mac  mail cant be running on other registered macs  for the first sync after this new feature. i replied to the support  reps email to find out what is up with such an odd quirk but i didnt receive a very useful answer.nevertheless after getting back to square one by resetting my signature data on both macs i can verify that this  fix works. hopefully this issue is on the list of  updates coming in 10.4.4. ,1231,1,3,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/24/fix-for-mac-sync-errors-with-mail-and-random-signatures/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/24/fix-for-mac-sync-errors-with-mail-and-random-signatures/,,,

norton av for os x makes a mac less secure ,Dec 26 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:internet tools:&:security , ah the  beautiful irony: last tuesday as many of us were getting ready for family and the holidays symantec admitted  that a serious security flaw has affected about 40 of their products including all versions of norton anti-virus nav  for os x. symantec calls this a high risk vulnerability that could allow a remote user to gain control of a computer  even a mac thats running any of their affected software. i havent  seen anything about a solution for either side of the fence yet so if youre crazy for security i dont envy the  dilemma a situation like this might put you in. an up-to-date and patched copy of os x is widely hailed to be pretty  secure these days so run software update - regularly! but the zdnet  australia article that we found this in poses the important security question pretty well: andquot;as the owner of a powerbook i am faced with a dilemma. do i pay au$118.15 for a flawed  security application that is designed to protect me from threats that do not seem to exist; or do i take sensible  precautions like keeping my computer behind a firewall and staying up to date with os x patches?andquot;no matter which side of the os x security/virus/malware debate you stand on a situation like this undeniably brings  these topics back into light with a new perspective. feel free to discuss in the comments but keep it clean; dont  make me come in there and separate you. ,1399,0,8,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/26/norton-av-for-os-x-makes-a-mac-less-secure/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/26/norton-av-for-os-x-makes-a-mac-less-secure/,,,

thunderbird 1.5 rc2 released, gets shinier ,Dec 27 2005 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:internet tools , ok so i lied: thunderbird isnt really any shinier i  just thought that headline might make c.k. download it faster on his quest for a mail replacement. but seriously it sounds like theyve  made some significant updates with rc2 when i thought release clients were simply about squashing bugs. among the list of updates: better automatic updates  spell checking as you type how bout it firefox?? redesigned options ui improvements to podcasting and rss built-in  phishing detection and more. these sound like nice upgrades to an app that reportedly and i agree beats the pants off  of mail in the imap department. still as hawk wings points out  thunderbirds inability to play well with lots of other os x apps lack of applescript support and just plain  andquot;butt-uglyandquot; ui can tarnish the thunderbird experience for some os x users. me? in my journey for  mail alternatives im slowly settling into the gmail way of things. its certainly a new experience going from a  desktop app to a web-app especially for something as intensive as handling the army of email i collect in a days  time but gmail does most of the things that i was using mail plugins for such as mailtags. plus since gmail went mobile i dont necessarily need to keep  my powerbook glued to my head 24/7 to keep on top of things so its been working out so far.at the end of  the day though its nice to see another large choice in email clients besides mail and *shudder* entourage especially  since thunderbird has a few unique tricks like rss reading up its sleeve. ,1544,0,3,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/27/thunderbird-1-5-rc2-released-gets-shinier/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/27/thunderbird-1-5-rc2-released-gets-shinier/,,

ipod says: turn left on mulberry st. ,Dec 29 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,ipod family:&:multimedia , i was thinking  yesterday about how apple could continue to improve and expand the ipod. sure weve talked about it becoming a piece of your entertainment center and about it  being used as an exercise aide a subway system atlas and as an e-book reader.this is all fine and good and  i continue to be impressed with the many different uses people are finding for their ipods. but what if it could be  better? what if your color-screen ipod video could also be a gps unit? imagine being able to use your ipod to navigate  around cities and strange countries. the high quality color screen is already there as is a decent interface. apple  already has their itunes store for synchronizing music and videos to an ipod. i dont see why it couldnt also be used  to synchronize maps directions and travel/tourist site-seeing information. who needs an expensive gps navigation  system for their car if they can get the same or similar functionality with a gps-equipped ipod? and the beauty is that  it wouldnt need to be tied to your car; you could detach it and take it with you.its true that i dont  know a huge amount about handheld gps systems and this is certainly just my crazy speculation but i dont see why  this couldnt be done maybe someone can tell me why it wouldnt be possible. apple could include a gps chip and  receiver in each high-end ipod and then users could purchase maps and other information from the itunes store. it would  certainly increase the manufacturing and therefore sale price of the ipod but id buy one for the increased  functionality. i can think of many ways in which id use a gps ipod.people are already putting google maps images  on their ipods. isnt this the next logical step? ,1711,1,6,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/29/ipod-says-turn-left-on-mulberry-st/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/29/ipod-says-turn-left-on-mulberry-st/,,,

mac mini as gaming console? ,Dec 31 2005 12:00AM,damien barrett,rumors:&:mac mini , heres a  blogger who speculates that perhaps apple will create a mac mini that will be the centerpiece of a media center  product. not a new idea. the difference between his speculation and that by dozens of others in the mac web is that he  suggests this mac mini media center product might also be a gaming  console. his reasoning is that if microsoft can make inroads into the media center market with the xbox 360 then  so can apple with an updated mac mini.interesting speculation but i think its just wrong. apple hasnt  been interested in being in the gaming console market for more than a decade. for the vast majority of game  manufacturers making their games run on macs is an afterthought if ever at all. already they must consider four  versions of their games: xbox ps2 gamecube and pc and as most gamers know some games never make even to the four  major platforms. and now....if this speculation is correct theyd have to consider a very small 5th platform? its  just not going to happen even if the new mac mini can run pc games natively wine-like execution layer windows-native  os etc.. furthermore microsoft has been buying their way into the gaming market for years taking a loss on every  xbox ever sold to the tune of $300  on each xbox 360 and theyre still not andquot;killingandquot; their competitors sony  and nintendo. apple doesnt need to be in the gaming console market to succeed in creating a successful  media center product. simply creating a product thats attractive and easy-to-use--perhaps incorporating a nice  programmable remote control--product to play media content from our pcs and from the itunes store will be enough to  make it successful. ,1685,0,12,16, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/31/mac-mini-as-gaming-console/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/31/mac-mini-as-gaming-console/,,,

open letter to mozilla: where firefox goes wrong on os x ,Jan 3 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:software:&:internet tools , firefox  inarguably is one of the coolest browsers available and a necessity if youre using windows. on os x however ive  been on the fence during firefoxs existence as there are a number of ways that firefox and mozilla have gone wrong and  ruined the browsers user experience.first up is mozillas directory of addons. useful as they may be these  sites are still clunky as you have to always have to adjust what youre searching for - even when youre already  browsing a specific section. further with the mountain of extensions and themes piling up there really needs to be a  way of limiting what addons you see to the version of firefox youre using. before i found foxmarks i was browsing the addons  directory for a bookmark synchronizing extension and bookmark synchronizer kept appearing  in the results even though it only works with firefox 1.0. while this frustrates me im sure its even more confusing  for all those users out there who can barely tell the difference between firefox and internet explorer.next  on the list is firefoxs lack of os x-ability. while windows xp is lagging behind with barely 20th century technology  hence the need for things like firefoxs password management os x already has a bunch of goodies baked in - like the  keychain and universal spell checking -andnbsp; that firefox really needs to take advantage of. virtually all other os x  apps place application and web passwords in os xs keychain a centralized resource the whole os can use. one merely  needs to copy the keychain database file and know its password of course in order to back up a record of all the  passwords they need to remember. throw in .mac service which can effortlessly sync your keychain amongst other things  with multiple macs and youll be on the next level of synchronization heaven. lets also not forget os xs built in  universal spell checking engine which offers a simple keyboard shortcut for a pop-up definition window. in other  browsers like safari omniweb and even camino there are no plugins or extensions needed to gain any of these essential  21st century computing features.so please mozilla answer the call of us firefox fans who are hoping for a  more os x-ified and more powerful version of your most fantastic of browsers. mac users everywhere will thank you and  i bet wed even buy a few tshirts too. ,2340,0,4,39, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/03/open-letter-to-mozilla-where-firefox-goes-wrong-on-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/03/open-letter-to-mozilla-where-firefox-goes-wrong-on-os-x/,,,

what needs to happen with tv shows on the itms ,Jan 3 2006 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,analysis / opinion:&:its:&:video , i almost gave  up complaining as my new years resolution when i realized that i gave up new years resolutions as my new years  resolution back in 2000.in any case since you all know i am rather fond of beating dead horses heres my  current gripe: last night arrested development and surface were both new episodes. i watched arrested  development knowing that i would be able to either grab surface off of itunes or via bittorrent later. as i  am up this morning preparing for work i check the itms and there is no new surface. apple and nbc both just  missed out on $1.99. ill grab the show off of bittorrent for free since its not ready to go when i need it. i also  have no problem doing this because i dont see how temporarily grabbing something off of the internet supposedly  illegal differs largely from recording it on my replay tv the night it was showing and downloading it to my computer  and then to my ipod legal.now whether this is really what i do or not wink wink the above paragraph  describes the actions of a certain percentage of the market that is escaping the sales of apple and the tv networks. if  apple and these networks really want to profit and change the face of media then they need to start releasing the shows  simultaneous with the airing of the show. they could even charge $.25 extra as an early bird fee and theyd most  likely make a lot more sales and a nice profit because thats why the itunes music store has been a success: its more  convenient than all the alternatives of questionable legality.also because of this on the morning commute  i wont be watching surface. ill be watching things like rocketboom and channel frederator. free  media daily and weekly with no odd restrictions. thats what the networks should be worried about more than  presenting a nice space between airing the shows and offering them for download. whats that? theyll lose advertising  dollars? well then how about you cut out the middle man and rather than distributing the shows for $1.99 through the  itms offer them for free with advertisements available from your website pre-formatted for the ipod and the psp in a  nicely scalable mpeg-4 format. slap it in an rss feed call it a podcast and that way anyone can subscribe to your  shows on any computer and you wont keep losing mindshare to new media. ,2327,0,4,28, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/03/whatneeds-to-happen-with-tv-shows-on-the-itms/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/03/whatneeds-to-happen-with-tv-shows-on-the-itms/,,

another stooge misses real drm dilemma, takes pot-shot at apple ,Jan 6 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,ipod family:&:its:&:apple , another  day another mindless shot across apples bow  arguing against their use of drm. this time around its coming from brad king at technology review. brad is upset  about the popularity of the itunes   ipod combo from apple arguing that the dynamic duo is leaving the door wide open  for the music and movie industries to tighten their grip around our digital content as much as they want. brad then  goes on to say that he doesnt mind all the drm on the microsoft/windows side of the fence since he has a tool belt  full of drm-cracking and dvd-burning apps that let him go on about his business. part of me wonders if brad just has a  hard time dragging and dropping certain  applications over from a disk image in os x.seriously though: i am a fan of most of apples products  and wouldnt you know im an ipod owner. however i am neither an apple fanboy nor a candidate for drm  evangelization and im happy to stick it to apple when its well deserved. my problem with brads article is this:  while apple might be in the spotlight of digital content and drm it seems like brad was partying when he should have  been doing his homework because apple is merely the tip of the iceberg in the ocean of all things drm. im not talking  about wmp restrictions or the fact that subscription music services are about 10 times more locked down than the itms  when it comes to cancelling your subscription. im talking about all the other new rules and regulations surrounding  nearly every emerging digital content device - whether its a white music player or not. a great example of the rest of  this iceberg is a post i had on downloadsquad back in august  about official documents detailing how hollywood is now directly dictating the way next generation computer software  and hardware will use encryption to protect content. crazy i know and you only get three guesses as to who authored  the document.apple isnt to blame for all this drm silliness any more than tivo or napster are - the  problem lies with the dinosaur that we call the entertainment industry. they are the gatekeeper to the at present big  and popular music tv shows and movies that most of us want therefore: they hold all the keys. the fact that apple was  the first to step up to bat and hit a home run with all this itms stuff is meaningless - the problem lies with who  controls all this content and what we let them let us do with it.[via macnn] ,2419,1,1,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/06/another-stooge-misses-real-drm-dilemma-takes-pot-shot-at-apple/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/06/another-stooge-misses-real-drm-dilemma-takes-pot-shot-at-apple/,,
siteflex stand offers a simple solution for your isight ,Jan 6 2006 12:00AM,jan kabili,accessories , granted this isnt a new product but if like me  youve got a free-standing isight camera and an older cinema display its indispensable. none of the mounts that come  with the isight fit the older cinema displays the kind with rounded transparent frames. so it can be frustrating to  position the camera where you want it. enter the sightflex by macmice. the sightflex is  basically a long firewire cable inside a metal gooseneck tube. you just plug the sightflex into the isight place the  small base anywhere on your desk and bend the flexible gooseneck so the camera is positioned where you want it. i was  happy to find that the sightflex is just the right height to hold the isight behind my 23-inch cinema display so i can  look directly into the camera while im working and the five foot firewire cable is long enough to reach the g5 under  my desk. the only downside is that now i have no excuse for avoiding video chats on a bad hair day.have any  of you tried the sightflex? how do you like it? ,1004,0,0,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/06/siteflex-standoffers-a-simple-solution-for-your-isight/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/06/siteflex-standoffers-a-simple-solution-for-your-isight/,,,

on power adapters, pmus and the new powerbooks ,Jan 7 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,hardware:&:powerbook:&:troubleshooting , as i  was using my one month old powerbook yesterday i was alarmed to see the charging light on the power adapter randomly  shift between orange and green. i came up empty handed after some googling and searching apples support pages so i  started plugging the adapter into other outlets in the apartment. no go; my adapter was still putting on its own little  glowstick show for me. i then decided to look up apples support document detailing the procedure for resetting a powerbooks pmu power management unit  which brings me to the first lesson i learned: apple changed the pmu reset procedure for the most recent 15andquot; and  17andquot; dual layer sd powerbooks so definitely check  it out if you go down this same road.unfortunately a pmu reset still didnt solve my dilemma. getting  nervous i finally decided to take advantage of apples insulting andquot;90 days of complementary supportandquot; to see  if they could bail me out. fortunately after some troubleshooting i learned my second lesson of the day: powerbook  and ibook adapters if left plugged into a wall for too long might need to actually be reset. this can easily be done  by unplugging both of an adapters ends for at least 60 seconds. we didnt delve into the inner workings of these power  adapters for an explanation but ive kept one plugged into a specific outlet in my apartment for probably at least a  month or two and i guess that might be just enough to make a power adapter a little confused in the head. so kids  remember: dont be like me. keep your power adapter happy and light-show free by unplugging it from time to time. ,1612,1,6,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/07/on-power-adapters-pmus-and-the-new-powerbooks/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/07/on-power-adapters-pmus-and-the-new-powerbooks/,,

blogbridge, a second look ,Jan 9 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:cool tools:&:internet tools , blogbridge might still be a little too rough around the edges to de-throne netnewswire - the webs most popular  newsreader on either windows or os x - but it has a rocking feature set that i think the folks at ranchero/newsgator  had better start paying attention to. c.k. took a look at a 1.0 release of blogbridge a while ago and i think its safe to say the app now at  version 2.7 has come quite a ways since then. the installation went smoothly and signing up for blogbridges free  web-based syncing service was easy which brings me to one of blogbridges strong features: the app can not only sync  newsfeeds headlines and even preferences with a free web-based newsreading service but you can categorize newsfeeds  with tags and sync those tags with del.icio.us.since i have such a huge library of categorized feeds one  seemingly minor feature i really appreciate about blogbridge is the ability to assign custom icons to the feed  categories making them much more easy to identify when trying to find just the right one. blogbridge has quite a few  other tricks up its sleeve such as feed-rating and smartfeeds which can pull keywords from your own feeds or parse  tags and keywords from other services like amazon feedster flickr google and technorati.all in all once  some kinks get ironed out i think blogbridge shows some real promise. its is available as a free download and since its java and open source it runs on os  x linux and windows. ,1455,0,3,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/09/blogbridge-a-second-look/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/09/blogbridge-a-second-look/,,

for me, a disappointing stevenote ,Jan 10 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:mac mini , color me a bit  disappointed in this years stevenote. its not a surprise that i was hoping for a mac mini media center and i know  im certainly not alone. the new macbooks meh...still getting used to the name and imacs are interesting and are a  nice step for apple into the intel world but neither machine fits my particular needs right now. what i want and need  are two things neither of which were released today by apple:1 a tiny lightweight  subcompact notebook capable of running mac os x. something like the sony vaio u3 or one of the toshiba libretto  models. or better yet a tablet pc thatll run something other than windows tablet edition or whatever theyre calling  it. the 12andquot; ibook and powerbooks are too big and too heavy and are the smallest things currently available from  apple. go ahead and ditch the optical drive but include firewire usb 2.0 bluetooth and airport. im certain theres  a market for these. until apple ships one ill be watching the hackers to see if anyone gets mac os x running on an  ultralight. it might be a legal grey area but im willing to buy an extra copy of mac os x and then install the  modified version on the ultralight or tablet that apple seems destined never to release.2  a media center computer that doesnt suck. have you tried to use windows media center? for lack of better language it  sucks. and i refuse to put at the center of my media center a virus and malware magnet. ive looked at mythtv but  dont have the time or linux knowledge to build one. the tivo series 3 is looking promising but it wont be out until  mid-year. a mac mini with an el gato eyetv device running hacked front row? thats another legal grey area but i may  find myself going that route.i suppose as far as stevenotes goandnbsp; it wasnt too bad but for me it  certainly delivered less than i had hoped for. current livejournal mood is disappointed. ,1891,0,1,30, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/10/for-me-a-disappointing-stevenote/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/10/for-me-a-disappointing-stevenote/,,

macbook pro - one step forward, two steps back? ,Jan 10 2006 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,macworld:&:analysis / opinion:&:hardware , im pleased as punch about the new macbook pro with  a few glaring exceptions. the speed is amazing. the magsafe power connector is a godsend. the screen is gorgeous. the  built-in isight is sweet and the slightly thinner form factor is a nice touch. but why drop the analog modem from a  road warriors mainstay machine? and why cant we get these suckers under 5lbs yet? and where the heck is the  significantly improved battery life? furthermore snubbing firewire by including only a single firewire 400 port is a  mistake in my book. usb 2 is all fine and dandy but for video firewire still rules. i have only mixed feelings about  the new expresscard/34 slot. i keep wondering how long it will take for all the pcmcia card manufacturers including  the evdo card makers to adapt.all that being said the speed of this puppy might finally sway me to give up  my 12-inch powerbook. granted id really really prefer it if the macbook would lose a pound or two but since i need to  lose a few pounds myself i guess i shouldnt judge! ,1029,0,7,45, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/10/macbook-pro-one-step-forward-two-steps-back/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/10/macbook-pro-one-step-forward-two-steps-back/,,

the good news for mac lab admins ,Jan 11 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,enterprise:&:tips and tricks , with the  release of new intel macs yesterday the people who manage labs and classrooms full of macs started asking  questions.does this mean i need to have a ppc image for my ppc machines and an intel image for my intel  macs? what about netrestore and netbooting? can these new intel macs even netboot? what about the lab management  tool/tripwire radmind?theres some good news to report. apple has shipped new mac os x 10.4.4 server admin  tools in which theres an updated  system image utility.app that can create netboot and netinstall images for intel-based macs. also mike bombich has  told us his most recent version of netrestore  3.1.1 is a universal application thatll work on both ppc and intel macs.from a mailing  list post made by a sr. product line manager for server andamp; storage support at apple:the new intel-based macs use a next generation pre-boot technology developed by intel  called efi.  efi provides a superior booting  experience and includes features such as a larger rom richer graphics  support full ip stack dynamic boot volume picker quicker startup times and even some cool feature such as the  ability to an apple remote to remotely control boot options.one of the benefits of efi is dramatically faster boot  times for netboot systems.  our internal tests show that in most situations  booting of an intel-based mac is 2-3 times  faster than the older open firmware-based systemsto netboot or netinstall an intel-based mac you need to deploy mac os x  server v10.4.4.  mac os x server v10.4.4 includes an updated system image utility for creating netboot and netinstall  images of intel-based macs.  separate disk images are required for powerpc-based macintosh computers and intel-based  macintosh computer. some other tidbits:%ufffd the open  firmware password tools still work on intel macs that use efi. and firewire  target-disk mode should also still work. so all our essential image-making and image-distribution tools still work.  yes well have to separate intel-mac image but thats not a bad chore. its certainly better than image-making in the  pc world where sometimes every model computer requires its own image. ,2165,0,2,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/11/the-good-news-for-mac-lab-admins/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/11/the-good-news-for-mac-lab-admins/,,,

iphoto 6: first impressions ,Jan 12 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,macworld:&:ilife:&:software , so i just  finished installing my copy of ilife 06 and since im the most interested in the new iphoto and iweb apps i thought  id post a few initial thoughts at least on the new iphoto which is technically now at version 6. ive been playing  with and poking at it for roughly 20 minutes so this will obviously be just a raw rundown of what ive noticed is new  and different so far:        starting using and quitting the app is noticeably faster. im running it on a  powerbook g4 1.67 ghz with 1.5 gb ram but ive still noticed a general increase in speed and responsiveness.       finally finally finally - the iphoto library folder in ~/pictures/ organizes your images the way an application  like this should. basically under a new andquot;originalsandquot; folder are folders dated by year and in those are  folders named by album with images arranged accordingly. thanks apple!      iphoto 6 now joins mail and itunes  with unified toolbar goodness.      full-screen viewing/editing is responsive and absolutely gorgeous though i  have one minor complaint: theres no way to get out the current album of images youre viewing unless you duck out of  full-screen. not a big deal but a minor nuisance.      theres a new advanced preference pane with the option:  andquot;copy files to iphoto library folder when adding to library.andquot; if this functions like the similar option in  itunes i assume this means iphoto doesnt necessarily need to move copy and/or duplicate images you have sitting  somewhere else on your mac.      the toolbar at the bottom of iphotos interface is now customizable allowing  you to toggle which buttons you actually have available down there.    i havent played with any of the  photocasting or iweb features yet but we hope to have some demos links and video examples ready for a vidcast by this  weekend or early next week so stay tuned! ,1874,0,3,42, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/12/iphoto-6-first-impressions/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/12/iphoto-6-first-impressions/,,,

hands on with the new ipod radio remote ,Jan 12 2006 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,accessories:&:audio:&:ipod family , so  yesterday was my birthday and just like any other good mac user i had to drag my wife to the apple store before going  to dinner. a pre-celebration celebration if you will. in any case they didnt have the new imacs in yet  but they did have the new radio remote for the ipod so i quickly bought one. ive posted a bunch of pics of the device  and its packaging over on my flickr account so make  sure you check out all the pics.so far ive only done minimal tinkering with the device but heres my  mini-review of cool bits ive noticed:if you havent run the latest ipod update the radio remote will work as  a remote but not as a radio.clicking on radio and tuning is a snap. hitting play temporarily turns off the  radio.the top headphone jack on my 5g ipod continued to work even when i had headphones plugged into the radio  remote. so its not just a radio its not just a remote its also a way to share your tunes with your friend or loved  one by plugging in two headsets one to the ipod and one to the radio remote. very cool.station information  shows up underneath the station number when listening. as i had it tuned to 92.3 k-rock in nyc the text free radio and  booker kept scrolling underneath the radio frequency.the remote is identical to the controls on an ipod  shuffle so i imagine it will have the same easy to control while wearing gloves quality.the included  headphones have the smaller stereo plug that comes with the nanos.the headphones plugged into the radio remote  act as the antenna so you cannot listen through the top port on your ipod with no headphones attached to the radio  remote. theres audio but it is all static.ill post more on this later after i really get a chance to put  this sucker to the test. i wonder how the battery life is if you are just doing radio 24-7... ,1809,2,2,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/12/hands-on-with-the-new-ipod-radio-remote/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/12/hands-on-with-the-new-ipod-radio-remote/,,

garageband 3: first impressions ,Jan 13 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,ilife:&:software:&:reviews , after  some initial impressions of iphoto 6 i figured  garageband should be next on my list as it too seems to have received some of the most significant updates in the  ilife 06 suite. as with the iphoto impressions its the same drill here: i opened garageband poked around in the  podcast studio and thought id post some impressions as a prelude to a real tuaw review:        once again  it feels like apple was able to add in a bunch of new features while at the same time making the app feel generally  zippier and more responsive. bake those code ninjas some cookies      when scrolling back and forth in a track  garageband also has a popup/overlay like iphotos that displays a real-time scrolling track time. awesome       you can add a parental advisory to your podcast right within garageband      the new project window has  both new andquot;podcast studioandquot; and andquot;new movie scoreandquot; options. i imagine the movie score works in tandem  with imovies      i absolutely love the media browser. i dont remember if the previous version had anything  like this but its present in the same form in all the other ilife apps and its incredibly handy       garageband asks you to change the podcast track to a video track if you simply drag a movie onto it. effortless  swapping between the two. it also splits a videos audio into a separate track for you to do with as you please       garageband has an andquot;exportandquot; preference pane with pre-set podcast export settings like mono spoken  musical and higher      that andquot;duckingandquot; feature jobs demoed is about one of the coolest and handiest  additions i can think of especially to a podcasting app    so thats it for now. stay tuned for more lengthy  reviews from tuaw as soon as we can put them together. ,1796,1,4,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/13/garageband-3-first-impressions/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/13/garageband-3-first-impressions/,,,

apple needs to fix their powerbook dl trackpad software ,Jan 14 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:software , ever  since i picked up this 15andquot; powerbook dl dual layer superdrive about a month ago i have occasionally run into  situations where i see the kernel_task in activity monitor spiking to about 60% cpu usage grinding my machine nearly  to a halt and making it generally unusable until i restarted. none of the typical maintenance tasks seemed to help  matters and since i was planning on wiping the book clean this weekend for the upcoming semester anyway i simply  chalked it up to some little utility i had been playing around with. oh the troubles i go through for you readers...well after wiping the book this morning and getting everything reinstalled huge time-saver tip: keep all your  3rd party apps in an applications folder in your home folder this way os x can still find them yet its easy for you  to back them all up i found i was still having these kernel_task issues - even before i installed all my extras.  getting frustrated i finally decided to do some googling and discovered that once again macosxhints had already gotten to the bottom  of this issue.as it turns out this kernel_task usage problem is a result of apples own trackpad software  horribly misbehaving on these latest powerbooks even on a 100% clean system which i verified this morning.  macosxhints did find a 3rd party solution in the form of sidetrack a shareware  trackpad software replacement for powerbooks and ibooks that has a few neat tricks up its sleeve. while i can verify  sidetrack fixed the issue on my powerbook it alters the behavior of two-finger scrolling and of course costs money  $15. i also cant stand some weird thing it does to mouse movement and acceleration; it feels and acts differently  than apple software and these two dings caused me to uninstall it and take my chances with keeping kernel_task happy  again.moral of the story: apple needs to fix their powerbook trackpad software and soon. this kernel issue  destroys productivity usability and battery life and also causes a powerbook to get pretty hot. if youre running into  issues like this or any other kind i urge you to add your voice to the pile at apple.com/feedback. ,2151,0,2,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/14/apple-needs-to-fix-their-powerbook-dl-trackpad-software/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/14/apple-needs-to-fix-their-powerbook-dl-trackpad-software/,,,

ipods will gain in battery life with new wolfson audio chip ,Jan 16 2006 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,audio:&:hardware:&:ipod family , wolfson microelectronics the company behind audio chips found in almost every ipod model is unveiling a low power masterpiece the wm8985. the new chip will give up to 70  percent more listening time according to wolfson. this means if your current ipod can play music for 14 hours a statistic for a typical 5g ipod with the new wolfson  chip and a similar battery the same ipod would be able to play for 23.8 hours.this type of statistic is  rather unrealistic because each ipod upgrade means larger screens and a higher screen brightness and therefore a device  that consumes more batteries. a 70 percent increase in battery life for this single chip is however quite a leap most  gains in chip power consumption are in the 20 to 30 percent range. it will be interesting to see if the wm8985 chip  stays at a price point favorable to apple with this new release.[via macworld uk] ,882,0,8,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/16/ipods-will-gain-in-battery-life-with-new-wolfson-audio-chip/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/16/ipods-will-gain-in-battery-life-with-new-wolfson-audio-chip/,,,

new core duo imac: first impressions ,Jan 18 2006 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,imac:&:reviews , so  yesterday i decided to be conservative save some money and purchase the 17-inch dual core imac which was in stock  at the palisades apple store rather than wait for the more expensive 20-inch to arrive.  after all ive already  ordered a fully-loaded top of the line macbook pro so i may as well be conservative with the imac. also someone at  the apple store screwed up because when i got the imac home and unpacked it i had a free upgrade to a wireless  keyboard and mouse. nice! i need to order more ram and the monitor adapter wish theyd included it... so i can plug  in another monitor and try the monitor spanning trick.as soon as i opened the box i lost the imac remote.  it turned back up about 25 minutes later and now i am keeping it stuck to the side of the imac.so far i  have to say this machine is very fast. even with only the default 512mbs of ram this baby launches programs  fast. safari and itunes are instantaneous in nearly everything with only a slight load screen when visiting the itms.  universal binary programs are all super fast and most of the programs running in rosetta still function very well as  long as they arent graphics intensive. unfortunately world of warcraft is quite laggy with frame-rates fluctuating  from 7-20 per second. i hope the universal binary  version comes out soon. iphoto is fast and cool but would seem to need some more ram to really zip through my 12k  photos. ill report more details later today and hopefully have a nice video podcast of the new machine for you  sometime today or tomorrow so stay tuned.i was disappointed to find that graphicconverter is no longer  bundled with the new macs but there is a universal binary version of  the application already available. for a full list of apps included with the new imac check after the break. ,1811,1,8,31, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/18/new-core-duo-imac-first-impressions/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/18/new-core-duo-imac-first-impressions/,,

undercover: mac anti-theft software ,Jan 19 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,hardware:&:software:&:cool tools , a  friend of mine sent me a link to a new piece of security/mac-tracking software called undercover. essentially this software runs in the background on your mac and  periodically pings an undercover recovery center. in the event of a stolen mac you can contact the center and they can  kick the software into gear collecting ip information and interestingly screenshots of whats happening on your  stolen mac. the idea is that if the thief is actually using his undeserved new prize he could sooner or later give  away details of his identity say with a chat name or checking email. if this andquot;plan aandquot; fails the undercover  center can then enact andquot;plan bandquot; causing the mac to act like its experiencing hardware failure which by  their logic would prompt the thief to either sell it or send it in for service. while im not sure how they could  determine the mac has again changed hands let alone come into the care of someone who would help undercover could  then make the mac display a message stating that it has been stolen along with contact information and the offer of a  finders fee.while this sounds like an ideal chain of events following the theft of your mac damien  brought up a couple great points as to why this software might have a limited if at all rate of success. first the  typical computer thief might find a way to erase the stolen computer which makes me wonder what kind of people damien  hangs out with. second if youre a portable notebook user concerned about security and theft you probably dont walk  away from the book while logged in and hopefully you dont set your book to automatically log in anyway. as far as i  understand how this software works both of these practices would render undercover useless as im pretty sure you  need to be logged in for the software to work its magic.ultimately you should probably check out more of  undercovers abilities and inner workings before jumping on it. orbicule the makers of undercover offer a customer  service/sales online chat option if youd like to talk to them more about it. at the end of the day its at least nice  to see some new thinking even if it might not be fool-proof in terms of portable computer security. ,2224,0,3,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/19/undercover-mac-anti-theft-software/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/19/undercover-mac-anti-theft-software/,,,

ipod as theological metaphor? ,Jan 20 2006 12:00AM,dave caolo,ipod family:&:open source:&:podcasting , metropolitan  baptist church pastor sal sberna of houston tx has been delivering a series of four andquot;ipod theologyandquot; sermons  that focus on the simplicity of the ipod. sal said that his intention is to tap into the pool of millions of ipod  owners who represent a potentially huge audience for his church. andquot;the reason the outside of the  ipod is so simple to use and so beautiful to look at is because of the way they designed the inside of the ipodandquot;  said sberna. andquot;all you do on the outside is push the little button drive the wheel and pick what  usefulness you want out of your ipod and so when jesus talks to us about simplification it must start on the  inside.andquot; if youve had any doubts about the ipods far-reaching appeal consider them squashed.kudos to the pastor for trying to reach a younger audience by embracing some current technology. he says he hopes to  one day make his sermons available as podcasts.[via ipod  garage] ,975,1,8,30, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/20/ipod-as-theological-metaphor/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/20/ipod-as-theological-metaphor/,,,

photoshop not universal until next version? ,Jan 20 2006 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,software:&:universal binary , our very own david chartier has posted on the unofficial photoshop  weblog that there are rumors that adobe  has no plans to make their current offerings into universal applications ones that run natively on both powerpc and  intel based macs. if this is true and at the moment this is pure conjecture then that would mean photoshop pros will  need to pony up the cash for the upgrade if they want to run photoshop on an intel mac. it is a given that most  photoshop pros would upgrade anyway so the real let down is the length of time that we would have to wait for the  upgrade to come around.lets hope this rumor is just that and adobe is feverishly working on a free a boy  can dream right? update to their cs2 apps that will make them universal applications. ,765,1,4,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/20/photoshop-not-universal-until-next-verion/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/20/photoshop-not-universal-until-next-verion/,,,

giving up on the debate ,Jan 21 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion , im  giving up on andquot;the debate.andquot; while i think apple is a great company i love their products and i  wont touch windows unless under penalty of death or bouncing a rent check i just cant be one of their soldiers  anymore. i am happy as a camper to answer genuinely interested questions but i cant fight those andquot;pcs do this  but os x does thatandquot; battles anymore. if my brothers only silly hangup is that he cant install os x  on his own hardware because apparently geforce cards are faster this week  or fellow classmates dont understand that two-button mice have worked on macs since os 8 and maybe earlier then  thats just the way it is. if my friend is happy with wireless networking that comes and goes with the wind and dvd  drivers that get uninstalled when a printer is plugged in through a *shudder* parallel port then who am i to argue?during such a positive and prosperous time for apple im sure they could still benefit from enthusiastic users  who can brave the questions of the unknowing masses and quell the unfounded myths but i just dont have the time or  patience to fill those shoes anymore. ive fought the fight and ive even helped quite a few pessimists find their  way but im going to have to leave the position for the sake of my sanity and my productivity. so today i  pass on the torch to the next set of champions who can help clear the clouds and pave the way for apple and their  mostly rockin products. im sure you all will do them proud as plenty of others have before you. ,1527,0,5,42, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/21/giving-up-on-the-debate/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/21/giving-up-on-the-debate/,,,
contest: dual-booting winxp and mac os x on intel mac ,Jan 22 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:odds and ends , heres a guy that so badly wants to run windows xp natively on his new intel-based mac that hes started a contest to pay the first person who can offer a working way to dual-boot  both mac os x and winxp on an intel mac.im all for the idea of having a computer than can run any os on  the market but i dont think dual-booting an intel mac is the answer. i feel a better solution is for apple to provide  a rosetta-like translation layer think wine for mac os x in which windows apps can run natively. just being able to  boot your intel mac into winxp does nothing for the monumental security virus and spyware problems that plague the  windows world almost all of which target the os or applications tightly integrated into the os.if apple  really wants to offer a competitive alternative to microsoft windows just think how attractive a computer would be  that could run natively every single piece of software on the shelf without having to reboot into a different os which  is very consumer unfriendly and also without windows security problems.just as microsoft is gearing up  for a windows vista launch this summer or fall as the date keeps moving apple could really make a splash by  announcing at wwdc their next version of mac os x with this kind of translation layer built in. ,1287,0,11,32, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/22/contest-dual-booting-winxp-and-mac-os-x-on-intel-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/22/contest-dual-booting-winxp-and-mac-os-x-on-intel-mac/,,,

ipod as a catalyst for dmca reform? ,Jan 24 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:audio:&:ipod family:&:multimedia:&:software:&:video , cnet news has a really interesting perspective piece highlighting the video  ipods potential for being a catalyst for dmca reform specifically: the outlandish portion that makes it illegal to  sell or distribute dvd-ripping software.the idea behind the article is that until now these measures of  the dmca havent really hit the radar of an audience outside the comparatively small segment of digital-rights  advocates. declan mccullagh the articles author believes that the video ipod could finally be the spark large enough  to get a much greater portion of consumers interested in and angry about the non-dvd-ripping limits on todays  software. while mccullagh mentions a few dmca-reform bills that are already floating around hes also quick to point  out that none of them at present have a very bright future.the video ipod according to mccullaghs  logic might be able to help all of this. with its wide popularity he thinks more and more users are going to start  questioning why its so easy for itunes to rip a cd to their library and ipod and yet the software balks at a dvd  movie. yes - before you start firing up the comment form there are still ways of getting a dvd off a plastic disc and  onto your favorite media player ipod or otherwise. but for the greater community of users out there dvd ripping is  still a thing of mystery and magic.i recommend you check out the full article as i think  its a really interesting read but theres one thing i want to add to the discussion; a factor that neither the  industry nor these politicians seem to examine: price. i wholeheartedly believe that if these companies cleaned all of  their andquot;market researchandquot; and andquot;value perceptionandquot; statistics out of their ears they would realize  that people are stealing content because they know the providers are taking them for a ride - and they wont put up  with it anymore. everyone knows cds cost pennies on the dollar and dvds cost even less than vhs tapes to produce yet  they retail for a far higher price. the rampant and as-yet unstoppable success off the itms is real world proof that  people will pay for the content maybe even more content as long as it has a fair price.but alas as with  all other political affairs our ability to copy dvds that we own will only change at the speed of bureaucracy. ,2333,2,1,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/24/ipod-as-a-catalyst-for-dmca-reform/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/24/ipod-as-a-catalyst-for-dmca-reform/,,,

poking around with photocasting ,Jan 24 2006 12:00AM,dave caolo,ilife:&:software , ive been  playing around with the new photocasting  feature of iphoto 06 recently. sadly no one in my family has a copy of ilife 06 so im unable to take part of the  fun. not wanting to be left out ive grabbed the rss feeds of some of my flickr  contacts to add to iphoto. it worked...kind of.for some reason the flickr feeds only display a users ten  most recent photos. dave chartier and i were messing around with this the other night deep in the hermetically sealed  tuaw offices and we confirmed this suspicion when he updated his own flickr pool to which i had subscribed. scary  thought. you can try it out by subscribing to our andquot;rigs of the dayandquot; flickr feed [link].subscribing to our  tuaw news feed [link] pulls the twenty most recent photos from our posts which  is kind of weird because it leaves you with a bunch of out-of-context images.when publishing a photocast  your outgoing images end up in web/sites/iphoto/ on your idisk and the images from subscribed photocasts land in  home/pictures/iphoto library/data on your mac im glad to see that iphotos method of arranging its library is no  longer a labyrinth of nested folders.its definitely a cool thing and if i were using it for its intended  purpose the grandparents in florida id probably love it. are you publishing/subscribing to any casts? ,1329,3,2,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/24/poking-around-with-photocasting/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/24/poking-around-with-photocasting/,,,

quicksilver scripts for tagging itunes songs, creating playlists ,Jan 25 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:cool tools:&:itunes , a macosxhints reader has put  together an interesting set of quicksilver scripts that will allow you to both easily tag your itunes music as it is  playing and create on-the-fly playlists based on these tags. the way they work is simple: while music is playing in  itunes you can use quicksilvers text abilities to easily add tags to the music files comments section. the beauty  here is that tags are prefixed with an asterisk * and they are appended to anything that might already be in the  songs comments field preserving what you might already have added. the second script allows you to create an itunes  playlist right from quicksilver based on any of your tags.i havent gotten to test these out yet but the  download includes detailed instructions from the authors site. ,780,1,3,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/25/quicksilver-scripts-for-tagging-itunes-songs-creating-playlists/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/25/quicksilver-scripts-for-tagging-itunes-songs-creating-playlists/,,

sitesucker pulls web pages onto your drive ,Jan 26 2006 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,software:&:internet tools , yeah i have grown accustomed to saving web pages as pdfs.  between spotlight support probably the only time i use it really and just the cool factor of having a mostly-universal  format for pages of info to carry around the save as pdf feature is terrific. however the limits are you cant get the  actual html css images or other media files that actually make the site. and if youre like me completely unafraid  to reverse-engineer some poor web designers brilliant css and use it yourself that pdf save wont get you there. so  sitesucker comes to my rescue.sitesucker is a very small app less than  1 mb and does one thing terrifically well: save all files and pages off a site. i would complain the interface takes  some effort but it doesnt really. the icons are confusing but no more so than plucker which i use to pull pages onto my wristpda. a few clicks and sitesucker  will save all the related files for a url into a folder on your computer. i got all the html css xml images swfs  even the favicon file. it will not follow javascripted links or many other files that coders might obfuscate for  protection purposes. but there is a os 9 version! the few sites i tried did pretty well but i didnt try more dynamic  sites like amazon. for simple web deconstruction and just fooling around this seems like a good app. its  donationware. ,1345,1,4,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/26/sitesucker-pulls-web-pages-onto-your-drive/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/26/sitesucker-pulls-web-pages-onto-your-drive/,,

tuaw tip: the importance of file extensions ,Jan 26 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,tips and tricks:&:education:&:tuaw tip , i teach a lot of computers users who are new to the mac experience or who have only ever known windows. and because  virtually every windows program names files with extension names already they have no idea what an extension name is  or that windows requires files to have file extensions so it can determine what kind of file it is and with which  program to open it.and so they move over to the mac and proceed to name files without extension names. of  course some programs like microsoft office and the adobe suite have been written to include file extension names by  default but there are just as many that still adhere to the old mac way of naming files--without extension names. and  so then they go to open their files on their pc from their flash drive or maybe they emailed them to themselves and  windows goes andquot;huh whats this?andquot; after double-clicking. theyre left thinking the file is damaged or that the  mac messed it up somehow when the problem is simply that its not named well enough for windows to understand what it  is.to further compound the situation apple has determined that the default way of viewing files in the  finder is to have the file extensions hidden. and so sometimes the file is actually named properly but when the user  looks at the file in the finder it doesnt show the extension name! and then they get confused and try to rename the  file and will sometimes get a warning box a scary thing for lots of new users asking them if theyre sure they want  to change the file name extension.my point is its really a mess. as much as i dislike having to adhere to  the stupid three-letter-extension name format imposed by the windows majority ive decided that its just easier to  teach people to always name their files with extension names. it wont hurt the mac to have them and windows requires  them so its the least confusing solution.i also set all the macs i control to have the finder always show  file extensions in its preferences. trivia: this attribute is actually stored in an invisible file called  .globalpreferences.plist in each users /library/preferences folder. ,2128,0,1,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/26/tuaw-tip-the-importance-of-file-extensions/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/26/tuaw-tip-the-importance-of-file-extensions/,,,

apple patent for mixed camera/pixel display ,Jan 26 2006 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,hardware:&:rumors , sometimes i really hope apple comes out  with some of the things they file at the us patent office. one such  example is this crazy cool andquot;integrated  sensing displayandquot; with mixed pixels and miniature cameras. [warning: patent images  best viewed with safari]in the patent filing itself apple denotes various ways imaging sensors could be  embedded into a display including the example i chose described as follows:andquot;integrating image  capture devices into the displays can be done with varying degrees of intrusiveness depending upon the type of  display. fig. 3a depicts an exemplary andquot;trackandquot; housing scheme of integrating image elements 305 into a deep  encased cell structure display 300 according to one embodiment of the invention. each image element 305 is integrated  into black strips 310 so that the spaces in-between each color cell 315 and 320 are used for both contrast enhancement  and image capture.andquot;this display looks as though its final function would be similar to a sort of  scanner or large cmos or ccd as well as be able to  display images. imagine being able to stick the display of your pda on a surface and have the image of said surface  which then would be flipped from the mirror effect displayed right on your screen. why would this be more interesting  than just having a webcam integrated into a laptop? well for one you would have a larger sensing field. secondly a  webcam is usually at the top of your screen making it semi-annoying to carry on a video conversation with someone on  the screen. some other applications of arrays of cameras include after-the-fact virtual camera motion and time dilation  think wachowski brothers and technologies invented for the matrix. im not sure this apple patent will be of a high  enough resolution for these applications but perhaps some inkling of virtual camera ability from the array will be  integrated.i dont know if apple will ever use this patented technology but i sure hope they do. feel free  to participate in rumor mongering in the comments.[via the mac observer] [camera array from stanford via hack-a-day siggraph coverage] ,2150,2,4,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/26/apple-patent-for-mixed-camera-pixel-display/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/26/apple-patent-for-mixed-camera-pixel-display/,,,

tuaw tip: put your apps wherever you want ,Jan 27 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:tips and tricks:&:tuaw tip , when you download a new application its installation process typically tells you to either drag it into your  macs applications folder or it has a full-blown installer that takes care of this process for you. but who says you  have to keep all your apps in the applications folder? many applications from firefox to quicksilver and even fcp and  photoshop can generally be run from nearly any folder on your mac allowing you to organize your applications any way  you see fit.why would this matter you ask? well if youre anything like me youve built up a healthy  collection of 3rd party apps that you use on a regular basis. if you want an easy way to either backup all these apps  or quickly bring them all over to another mac you can simply keep them in a folder in your home folder. this way you  can still use them and call them with tools like quicksilver os x can still find them and you can easily keep track  of just your apps that matter most. this also saves a lot of time if you ever decide to do some serious andquot;spring  cleaningandquot; and wipe your entire mac.now one word of caution with this tip: as a general rule exercise  care when moving around any of the big apps as well as the apps that used a full-blown installer. i had no troubles  moving the entire photoshop cs2 folder and final cut pro.app to my desktop and running them but i have no idea if a  move like that could affect the functionality of things like plugins or other addons. my personal rule of thumb which  hasnt failed me yet is that if an app is a simple drag and drop install it doesnt necessarily have to live in the  main applications folder. if youve been using a similar trick like this tuaw readers feel free to  discuss your ideas in the comments. ,1751,0,3,23, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/27/tuaw-tip-put-your-apps-wherever-you-want/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/27/tuaw-tip-put-your-apps-wherever-you-want/,,,

now playing plugin for itunes ,Jan 29 2006 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,software:&:itunes , this now playing plugin for itunes looks like it  has great potential. it does a couple of things and promises to do more once it is no longer in beta.what  does it do you ask? it creates an xml file of the song you are currently listening to in itunes and stores it on your  hard drive or you can set it to ftp it to a remote server. this allows you to set up on of those currently listening  things on your blog using some programming kungfu to make the xml into some more presentable.at the  moment that is all it does but this is a very early beta release. looking for amazon and itunes music store ties in to  come soon. ,627,0,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/29/now-playing-plugin-for-itunes/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/29/now-playing-plugin-for-itunes/,,,
newsmac pro 1.2.3 is awesome, nnw beware ,Jan 29 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:internet tools , as you  might remember newsmac pro 1.2 brought some nice enhancements when it landed last november. even though this latest version  is just a .0.3 update i think this app is finally maturing into a serious reader and i also hope the netnewswire  people are paying attention to what rory prior is doing with this most excellent of newsreaders.this latest  version brings typical things like bug fixes and new features to the table but i think a couple of the most important  new options are a new view now a total of 4 for arranging your feeds and headlines as well as more keyboard support  for moving between groups feeds and headlines. while using the keyboard isnt nearly as smooth as it is in  netnewswire newsmac pro is getting there and i hope more users submit requests to move this feature up rorys  priority list. most serious folks i know who use rss apps barely touch their mouse while theyre in the app and i  think it would serve newsmac pro well to gain this ability asap.a couple other big strengths newsmac pro  has are flagging headlines with different colors based on user-defined keywords as well as an itunes-style built-in  podcast player so you can keep everything under one roof if you so desire.with all this great stuff  coming to life in newsmac pro it certainly isnt still without its shortcomings. the demo casts off a time limit in  return for allowing a user to add only 10 feeds. i cannot stress enough how bad of an idea this is as i would imagine  anyone looking at an rss app like this is going to have far far more than 10 feeds in their opml which reminds me:  newsmac pro fortunately supports opmls with groups. the other clunky thing is the way feed and group updating is  defined. you can specify different update intervals 30 minutes 1 hour etc. for each group of feeds which is  certainly nice for some uses but i cant find a way to specify any kind of a default for the app as a whole.all things considered i think newsmac pro is a great newsreader that includes some very appealing innovations in the  world of rss reading and organzing. if youre in the market for a great way to keep track of all your favorite sites and  blogs head over and pick up a demo. if it really floats yer boat a  full license costs a mere $24.95. ,2270,1,0,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/29/newsmac-pro-1-2-3-is-awesome-nnw-beware/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/29/newsmac-pro-1-2-3-is-awesome-nnw-beware/,,

apple trademarks andquot;mac proandquot; in new zealand ,Jan 30 2006 12:00AM,dan pourhadi,rumors:&:powermac g5 , listen  hither ye name-bashing heathens: apple made a gutsy move kicking creativity in the crotch by axing the  andquot;powerbookandquot; moniker on the pro laptop line and changing it to andquot;macbook proandquot; but steve made his  intentions very clear during the macworld keynote by blatantly stating andquot;were done with powerandquot;  figuratively of course.that move led many of the mac elite to embark on spiritual journeys to the depths  of silicon valley contemplating the unanswerable questions of the future: will apple rename the ibook to  andquot;macbookandquot;? whats going on with the powermac will it just be named...andquot;macandquot;? maybe andquot;mac proandquot;?the  skilled macology researchers at appleinsider dug into the matter and uncovered a series of ancient 3  months old texts that if  interpreted properly may answer some of those very questions. according to the document apple filed for the trademark  andquot;mac proandquot; in new zealand last november following its recent trend of applying for trademarks in foreign nations -- presumably to  prevent snoops im lookin at you ai! from uncovering and interpreting them.does this mean the powermac  may soon follow in the powerbooks footsteps destined to eternal enslavement in the world of the has-beens? this  document certainly seems to lend credence -- but like nostradamuss predictions of the future well just have to wait  and see. ,1429,0,1,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/30/apple-trademarks-mac-pro-in-new-zealand/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/30/apple-trademarks-mac-pro-in-new-zealand/,,,
location x - automatically adjust settings on the go ,Jan 30 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:cool tools:&:ibook:&:internet tools:&:powerbook , if youre an ibook/powerbook user who is constantly fiddling with various settings depending on where you are  point your mouse towards location x for the solution  to all your preference-changing woes. i only played with this for about 5 minutes before plunking down my $20 for it  as i am already in love. this app makes me cry out andquot;why doesnt os x do this already??andquot; then i realize im  alone in my apartment right now which just makes me feel weird.anyway location x is essentially a  management app for all the various settings you might have to constantly set and reset depending on which networks  your mac connects to throughout the day. for example: in between classes i use wifi at starbucks since all of the  networks on my campus have most of their ports restricted. well starbucks wifi treats smtp servers that require  authentication in an odd way so im constantly having to change my smtp server when i sit down for a cup o joe. but  location x as you can see in my screenshot can do so much more. not only can this latest v2.5 do automatic network  detection it can set default printers adjust energy settings change browser homepages run applescripts change  security preferences and so much more. it even has a plugin architecture opening the doors for anyone else  to build in even more settings and functionality.i highly recommend this app for any of you mobile warriors  out there who are tired of constantly adjusting settings like these simply because youre on the go during the day.  location x is shareware which costs $20 a bargain if you ask me while a demo that allows for 8 location switches is  available here. ,1655,2,2,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/30/location-x-automatically-adjust-settings-on-the-go/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/30/location-x-automatically-adjust-settings-on-the-go/,,,

imac core duo quirks ,Jan 30 2006 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,imac:&:universal binary , no this isnt a pic of our rig of the day. its my rig. ive had my imac core duo for a few weeks now so i thought  id provide some more impressions for those of you still on the powerpc side of the processor divide. monitor spanning  works nicely especially with a nice screen like the 24-inch dell featuring the same a similar lcd as  apples 23-inch cinema display but with an extra inch of visibility better resolutioncontrast and a  slew of extra usb ports and a built in memory card reader. im still only running the default 512mbs of ram but i  only really feel the lack of ram when i launch one of the media-heavy ilife apps especially iphoto when i have a lot  of apps open or when i run apps in rosetta. for the most part the new imac is still blazingly fast.i have  noticed a few oddities with rosetta. i cannot always drag documents to word in the dock or pictures to photoshop in the  dock to launch the program and open the document / picture as i can with native apps. i can launch the program this  way but it will often not open the file after launch. if the app is already running then this sporadic inability to  open files doesnt seem to occur. also rosetta apps have crashed on me from time to time. native apps run fine.another issue: where is x11? i cannot find it installed on the machine and cannot seem to find an installer  that works online. i downloaded the intel-savvy ports of ooo and the gimp but  neither will run since there doesnt appear to be any installation of x11 on the imac. if somebody knows where i can  find x11 let me know. update: found an install optional installs app on the disk that came with the imac  and x11 would appear to be the only of the apps listed that wasnt installed by default. odd.the processor  is fast. i know i keep saying that but yesterday i used the free universal binary version of isquint to batch process about 10 movies into ipod format in just a few hours. much  faster than either my old g4 powerbook or my old g5 powermac. overall im loving the new imac but i am noticing  little spots of bugginess here and there and im hoping that recent core duo problems in windows land dont end up being  issues with our macs. ,2189,1,0,24, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/30/imac-core-duo-quirks/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/30/imac-core-duo-quirks/,,

gl image browser ,Jan 31 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:cool tools:&:odds and ends , gl  image browser is one of those great little free apps that im sure will quickly find its way into a lot of docks. as  the author says at geekologic.com: andquot;it is no  iphoto or picasa clone gl image browser is not meant as a tool to archive pictures but as a tool to quickly browse  through thousands of pictures to find a special one you are looking for.andquot; its really simple: you can give gl  image browser a directory to browse through with an option to toggle whether it parses subdirectories. clicking on an  image displays it in a full-screen window at which point you can either use your keys to keep navigating or you can  click again to get back to your desktop and the image browser. right-clicking an image will reveal it in the finder. i  dont think it gets much simpler than this folks. i also dont see much in the way of system requirements other than  quicktime since it apparently uses that somehow in the back end of the app. as i mentioned before gl  image browser is free and i dont even see an option on the authors site to donate. either way enjoy this most  excellent of handy little apps.[via macnn] ,1136,1,3,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/31/gl-image-browser/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/31/gl-image-browser/,,,

ibiz updated, goes universal ,Jan 31 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:productivity:&:universal binary , ibiz is a great time and billing management app for those who are  self-employed or otherwise might have a need for keeping track of their projects right down to the minute and dime. it  integrates well with address book and ical for all your contact and todo needs which is great for example if a client  would like to see a published calendar of the time youve spent on their project.ibiz also acts a bit like a  file/project management dashboard as you can associate files with a project in ibiz and automatically start timing you  work when you open the file from within the app. once a project is done ibiz also offers a healthy array of invoice  options ready for print pdf and/or email. networking capabilities are also baked in with an ibiz server edition  available but i dont work in that environment so i dont have much to say on that end.it looks like we  havent mentioned ibiz on tuaw before but i can personally vouch for it as a great app since ive been using it for a  couple years now. this latest update brings it to version 2.5 with better ibank integration and bug fixes and also  adds universal binary goodness. a 10-day demo is available while a single user license will run you a mere $29.99. ,1217,0,5,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/31/ibiz-updated-goes-universal/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/31/ibiz-updated-goes-universal/,,

motorola slvr with itunes now available from cingular ,Jan 31 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,hardware:&:itunes , motorola  has unleashed the slvr with itunes for cingular a slim new candybar style phone that borrows from their runaway-hit  razr design. as engadget notes its selling for  $199 better than the rokrs initial $249 with a 2-year contract comes pre-installed with a 512 mb card and that  oh-so-loved ceiling of 100 songs. once again motorola included a non-standard headphone jack forcing buyers to use an  annoying little adapter in order to be able to plug in a regular set of headphones.even though the slvr  phone itself certainly seems to be a nice upgrade from the bulky and sluggish rokr it still doesnt strike me as a  serious music phone offering. the many reasons and theories for this have certainly been discussed since the rokrs introduction so ill spare you a rehash. while some might be quick to bash motorola for breaking their promise that the rokr 2 wont  suck just remember: this isnt technically the rokr 2 so theres still hope. but what do you tuaw readers think  of this? is this the killer itunes phone youd sell your own dog to get your hands on? or did motorola and apple miss  the train again? ,1120,0,1,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/31/motorola-slvr-with-itunes-now-available-from-cingular/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/01/31/motorola-slvr-with-itunes-now-available-from-cingular/,,,

itunes in germany: is it the most popular? ,Feb 1 2006 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,its , sales reports from germanys itms show that there were  15.5 million songs sold through the service in 2005. t-onlines musicload claimed 15 million song sales as well but  included free downloads in their estimate unlike apple.what shocked me more than those fairly close figures  is the figure that the itms accounts for 80 percent of  all legal downloads in the world. following high tax  levies on digital music downloads devices and blank cd/dvds in europe its a wonder people dont just pirate  everything. a highly contested new  tax on media playing devices in switzerland is set to go into effect on march 1st.in other german news  i sure hope that germany will gain some  apple stores this year as rumored. it would be handier for me to be able to step into an apple store to drool over  all the new releases in person rather than virtually. ,850,4,1,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/01/itunes-in-germany-is-it-the-most-popular/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/01/itunes-in-germany-is-it-the-most-popular/,,,

tuaw tip: drag and drop with exposandeacute; ,Feb 1 2006 12:00AM,dan pourhadi,productivity:&:tips and tricks:&:tuaw tip , drag and  drop is one of the many wonders of graphical user interfaces exponentially increasing productivity with an intuitive  common-sense approach that leaves you with a reaffirmed belief in the unquestionable brilliance of mankind.  exposandeacute; takes that to a whole new level: you can actually navigate exposandeacute; while dragging a file/item  allowing you to easily locate and drop it into the right window.example: youre surfin in safari when you  run across an image of bob the builder that would work perfectly as a title slide in your andquot;timmys first  halloween!andquot; home movie project in imovie. but imovie is buried behind ical mail and that word doc of your thesis  youve had open for five years designed to remind you that andquot;one day...[youll] get it to one day.andquot; what are  your options? well you could save the image to the desktop pop into imovie then import it that way. or save it to  iphoto and use the media browser to locate and load it in. both options require extraneous and tedious steps as well  as an extra file youll almost certainly never need again.instead you could do this: grab the image and  without releasing the mouse button load exposandeacute; f9 is the default. drag the item over the imovie window and  wait a few seconds or hit spacebar -- then pop the image into one of imovies media boxes where it will be  automatically imported into your project. the same kind of thing works for all sorts of items: dragging files between  finder windows text from one app to another urls across browsers etc.cool huh?update: some readers made a great point something i shouldve originally mentioned: instead of  having to use a second hand to hit the f9 key just set an exposandeacute; hotcorner and perform the drag-and-drop with  nothing more than a swift motion of the mouse. i have my bottom-left corner set up for exposandeacute;s all windows  option and its great for drag-and-drop scenarios. thanks chadster and rolphus. ,1986,0,8,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/01/tuaw-tip-drag-and-drop-with-expos/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/01/tuaw-tip-drag-and-drop-with-expos/,,,

tuaw tip: keep a mail.app message open when replying ,Feb 2 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,internet tools:&:tuaw tip , todays tip  involves a mail.app hint i found that i thought was just too handy not to mention. if you use mail.app and you open  some messages in their own window you might have noticed that if you hit reply the original message disappears in  favor of your new message composition window. understandably this is a source of frustration for many a user.fortunately rob griffiths over at macworld has discovered a  simple way around this: hold the option key when hitting reply reply all or forward and the original message will stay  put while a new separate composition window opens. this makes it a little easier to refer back to the original message  especially if its lengthy.this works on tigers mail.app but i dont have any older versions of mac os x  to verify this on. feel free to sound off in the comments if youve tested this on panther or even jaguar. my one  complaint about this trick: it doesnt seem to work if you use the keyboard shortcut for reply. holding option when  hitting cmd - r results in that funk/hault sound informing me that the shortcut is a no-go. either way this should  still be a handy trick for you chronic repliers using mail.app.[via hawk wings] ,1185,0,4,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/02/tuaw-tip-keep-a-mail-app-message-open-when-replying/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/02/tuaw-tip-keep-a-mail-app-message-open-when-replying/,,,

tuaw tip: take control of your sidebar ,Feb 3 2006 12:00AM,dave caolo,os:&:tuaw tip , todays tip is all  about your finder sidebar. ive altered mine a bit from the default setup to better accommodate the way i work. the  first thing i do is to remove the movies music and pictures folders. theyre really only a single click away from my  home folder plus i use itunes to manage my music and videos and iphoto handles my photos. so i rarely need to go  poking around those folders manually. to remove a folder or other item from your sidebar simply click and drag it out  of the list then let go and its gone.next ive brought in my current projects. to add an item to the  sidebar simply click and drag it into place. a thin blue line appears between existing items. drop it in and youre  all set.the four folders you see below my andquot;documentsandquot; folder contain the files that are currently receiving  all of my attention. now theyre only a click away no matter where ive navigated to in the finder. the  andquot;trashandquot; is actually a super simple apple script that reads:on opentell the application  andquot;finderandquot;move the selection to the trashend tellend openi saved my script as an  application moved it to my andquot;documentsandquot; folder gave it a sweet icon from the iconfactory and dragged it into my sidebar. anything dropped onto it will be  moved to the trash. finally my quickdrop folder is where i store all the junk that i accumulate during the day i like  a clean desktop. at the end of the day i decide what i want to keep from in there move those items to their proper  locations and send the rest to the trash. ,1570,0,8,25, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/03/tuaw-tip-take-control-of-your-sidebar/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/03/tuaw-tip-take-control-of-your-sidebar/,,,

my swanky vaja ipod case ,Feb 6 2006 12:00AM,dave caolo,accessories:&:ipod family , back in  december i used some of my christmas money to order an ipod case from vaja and today it finally arrived. i now  believe in love at first sight.it comes nicely packaged with some propaganda flyers stickers etc. that  my 2 year old immediately claimed. i went with a hunter green for the front and a dark brown for the back but there  are literally dozens of color combinations available to choose from. the rear of the case is quite firm with the logo  printed on the interior. the front is soft but not squishy and the ipod fits in beautifully. the hold button and  headphone jack are exposed as is the port on the bottom so charging via the cable is no problem though it wont fit  in a dock while inside the case.theres both a screen protector and a click wheel protector the click  wheel protector is optional that a scratch-o-phobe like me appreciates. the wheel protector does require me to press a  little more firmly on the click wheel itself but not so much that its a nuisance. there are two styles of  beltclip available but i opted for no clip. im just as happy keeping it in a pocket and its now so well protected  that i dont have to worry about damaging it.overall i really love it. the leather is quite nice the  construction is very good it should be it took 29 days the fit is fantastic and the peace of mind that i wont  scratch the daylights out of the screen is nice too especially when i try to resell it a few years from now. on the  downside i cant connect it to the universal dock or my griffin roadtrip while in the case but im willing to live  with that. the vaja i-volution starts at $70us. more pictures after the jump. ,1657,0,23,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/06/my-swanky-vaja-ipod-case/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/06/my-swanky-vaja-ipod-case/,,,

my other issues with iweb ,Feb 6 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:ilife:&:surveys and polls , adding to the  small pile of gripes with the new technology apple is using with ilife 06 such as complaints about iwebs bloated css or rss standards and photocasting i just developed a  beef that i havent really seen mentioned yet: the crummy new url scheme for iweb sites both on and offline.first of all in the olden day the .mac andquot;homepageandquot; didt seem to be case sensitive as in:  homepage.mac.com/user will get you to the same place as /user. iweb is a bit pickier as a wedding site im working on  lives at web.mac.com/myuser/iweb/wedding/ but /wedding/ will result in a 404 error. yes a friend already reminded me  that andquot;unix = case sensitiveandquot; but i dont care. while this could be labeled a minor complaint my fiance and  i have plenty of family members who arent too hip on these computer thingies. theyre going to get confused by  something silly and minor like this and im sure our relatives arent the only ones.next on my list is the  url scheme itself. web.mac.com/user/iweb/sitename? could that get any less friendly? granted  andquot;homepage.mac.comandquot; might seems a little unprofessional to some but this new scheme feels pretty cumbersome  and just plain ugly. why couldnt we simply have web.mac.com/user and web.mac.com/user/othersites apple?last but not least is how the new sites are organized in a users idisk. old homepage sites still live in  idisk/sites/ while shiny new iweb sites live in idisk/web/sites/iweb/sitename. nevermind a discussion about how  needlessly buried that file structure is - im sure this dichotomy of old/new sites and content is going to confuse  plenty of .mac customers if they ever want to get at any of those files or make a backup of their sites or entire  idisk.but enough about my gripes what do you guys think: do iweb and its underpinning .mac support have  more issues besides css and standards? lets hear your thoughts. ,1909,0,27,29, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/06/my-other-issues-with-iweb/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/06/my-other-issues-with-iweb/,,,

tuaw tip: easily open a file or folder location ,Feb 6 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:tuaw tip , heres an easy tip for quickly opening the  finder location of a file you currently have open in almost any app.let say for example that youre  working in photoshop on an image thats buried a few folders deep within your home folder. youd like to get to that  files location but unless youve used dave caolos tip for taking control of your sidebar or you  have another trick up your sleeve it requires clicking on the finder icon in the dock then digging deep into the  folder system. well to bypass all that clicking all you have to do is command click on the small icon at the top of  the image window in photoshop to open a popup list pictured of the full directory structure leading to your file. as  you can see my hard drive is named stewie yes i use family guy character names for my drives and my home folder is  named dcharti. i could then click on any of the folders in that list to immediately open it in the finder making it a  lot easier to boogie around in the file system.the beauty of this trick is that it *should* work in any os  x app that has a file icon like photoshop in the windows title bar not the white menu bar which sits at the very  top of os xs desktop and even in some apps that dont necessarily display that icon. try it in word and illustrator.  then try command clicking on safaris title bar as it will give you a list of urls the frontmost tab has visited like  a tab-specific history. you can even open something like a local pdf file in safari and it will give you the directory  list. i bet this works in all sorts of other apps i havent even tried yet but it doesnt seem to work in  database-driven apps like mail.app and netnewswire. if you find some handy extras with this trick feel free to add  them to the pile in the comments. ,1772,0,26,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/06/tuaw-tip-easily-open-a-file-or-folder-location/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/06/tuaw-tip-easily-open-a-file-or-folder-location/,,,

murdoch not quite ready to jump on the itunes bandwagon ,Feb 7 2006 12:00AM,dan pourhadi,multimedia:&:itunes , have you  ever watched the office? me neither -- not until it showed up on itunes i mean. i tried watching it once on tv but  the siren-like seductiveness of my beautifully-curved tivo remote took hold of my consciousness prompting me to change  the channel to something a little more...i dont know entertaining. i dont even remember the episode i was  watching. all i can recall thinking was the typical andquot;i dont get itandquot; -- i joined the show five minutes in  and three minutes later there was a commercial break leaving me grasping for anything that may hint at the purpose of  this slow-starting 100%-dialogue-dependent comedy.i never bothered watching again...that is until my  brother downloaded an episode from itunes nearly relapsed to his old habit of bed-wetting because of laughter joke!  and forced me to sit down and share with the him the joy of a formerly-british sitcom starring the guy who romanticized  the notion of a 40-year-old man living alone with a video game chair and wall-to-wall action figures. the flexibility  of watching this show when i wanted where i wanted developed in me a newfound appreciation for its genius -- something  i can honestly say would never have happened if it was limited to the confines of tv schedule. and as weve seen im  not the only one learning about this comedy-fest via itunes -- its gotten so popular because of online downloads nbc  bumped the once-faltering show to a primetime thursday  slot.which makes you think things are going well -- until of course a media exec slaps you in face  chastising you for foolishly believing that content companies are starting to andquot;get it.andquot; this time its news  corps holy founder rupert murdoch who says itunes  and its video distribution deals are andquot;very small-time at the momentandquot; citing the ipods small display as a  reason people may not want to shell out $2 an episode for something they could see for free on tv.youd  think hed look at successes like the office and put the whole concept into perspective: fox has little to lose by  putting its shows on itunes and a heckuva lot to gain: revenue ratings interest etc. a fox/itunes distribution deal  could be huge for both news corp and apple -- and the only thing holding it back is murdochs riaa-styled fear of the  future that or hes got his own scheme in the works which i certainly wouldnt put past him.whatever. i  just want my family guy.[via cnet] ,2447,3,21,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/07/murdoch-not-quite-ready-to-jump-on-the-itunes-bandwagon/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/07/murdoch-not-quite-ready-to-jump-on-the-itunes-bandwagon/,,,

tuaw tip: view long file names faster in list/column view ,Feb 14 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,os:&:software:&:tuaw tip , a lot of mac users know and love the finders column view. while i cant speak for linux im pretty sure its a  fairly unique view to mac os x and its a great way to browse and move files throughout your folder system. todays  tip however deals with one of the column views occasional shortcomings: its relatively default thin column widths.  since long file and folder names get truncated in the column view it isnt always easy finding just the right one in a  long list of chopped-off and summarized names. instead of holding your mouse over a long file or folders name and  waiting for its full title to appear as a tooltip there is a much quicker way to do it: simply hold down the option  key. this will cause the tooltip to appear immediately and if you keep browsing in the same directory you can let go  of the option key as it actually toggles this immediate tooltips functionality on while you remain browsing in that  folder. this also works in file open/save dialogs where the column view can typically get scrunched the most.via [apple.com/pro] ,1056,1,1,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/14/tuaw-tip-view-long-file-names-faster-in-list-column-view/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/14/tuaw-tip-view-long-file-names-faster-in-list-column-view/,,,

cringely: apple/blockbuster speculation ,Feb 16 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:rumors , since today  seems to be speculation dayandtrade; heres another one for you this time a little more grounded in reality than dvoraks column about  apple dumping mac os x in favor of windows. robert x. cringely who has a much better track record at examining the  tech industry and then predicting what companies will do has posted today a speculative and engaging article about the  potential powerhouse partnership of apple and  blockbuster.andquot;apples blockbuster product strategy is simple. start with a new ipod that has  video- and audio-out capability. this ipod -- which will be just as good at playing songs as any ipod that preceded it  - will be more than just a video storage device. it will be a video player. no make that plural - players - a whole  family of video-out ipods some with flash storage and others with little disk drives.take your video-out  ipod to blockbuster drop it in a kiosk dock then download from the local xserve your choice of 50000 movies. you can  rent the movie or buy it and you can even choose the resolution which may or may not affect the final price. take the  ipod home drop it in the dock attached to your tv and watch the movie. h.264 decoding takes place in the ipod in  hardware.for apple the point here is to sell ipods to people who might not otherwise every buy one my mom  for example to bring digital downloads to people who dont have broadband or even a computer and to make it all  incredibly easy. you dont even have to return the videos when you are done since they will automatically  time-out.andquot;such a move would truly be a win-win for both apple and blockbuster. apple could supply  the back-end x-serves x-sans etc. to run such a system. theyre already signing distribution deals with the  movie studios entertainment distributors and itd sell a significantly larger number of ipods to  users. all apple would need is the name recognition and physical locations of a chain like blockbuster to make such a  program work. blockbuster would have a new revenue stream and enjoy the status of being aligned with a  technically-savvy company like apple. and lets not forget that steve jobs is now intimately aligned with disney a  company that actually is somewhat clueful about emerging technology.of course this is entirely speculation  but i think cringely may be on to something. apples clearly been planning something remember apple tends to plan  things a least a year or two ahead of an actual release. perhaps this is it; perhaps theyre finally putting the  andquot;pod back into ipod.andquot; ,2569,2,6,25, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/cringely-apple-blockbuster-speculation/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/cringely-apple-blockbuster-speculation/,,,

possible mac os x trojan horse mostly harmless ,Feb 16 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:os:&:internet , so  i saw the news this morning about a possible first trojan horse for mac os x and decided i didnt really want to deal  with the inevitable ensuing hysteria flames and crazy comments that would be sure to follow such a post. it was  8:00am and just way too early to deal. i mean if i want to read stupid comments about macs all day long ill just  spend my time over at digg.heh heh..i thought to myself ill let some other tuaw staff member post this  news story. then they can deal with the puerility.but now its almost noon and something like 42  people have sent in a tip and no ones stepped up to the plate so i figure i probably should write up something.heres a quick summary:andnbsp; someone uploaded a trojan horse to the macrumors.com forums which claims to be a  .tgz archive of screenshots of apples upcoming mac os x 10.5 leopard. problem is that it seems to be a  proof-of-concept trojan and isnt very successful at doing what its supposed to do which is propagate itself out via  your im buddy list. andrew welch who founded ambrosia software thanks for apeiron btw! has been doing a bang-up  job of dissecting the trojan and has determined that its mostly harmless. you can read the specifics in the ambrosia forums. sophos has already posted a definition for this trojan here.the  bottom line is that this really seems to be a proof-of-concept trojan more than an actual andquot;in the wild  self-propagatingandquot; virus. so yeah its certainly very interesting but im not about to start watching for the sky  to fall. leave that to cartoon birds storybook characters and pc magazine columnists. ,1615,0,16,17, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/possible-mac-os-x-trojan-horse-mostly-harmless/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/possible-mac-os-x-trojan-horse-mostly-harmless/,,,
dvorak off his meds: claims apple switching to windows ,Feb 16 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:software , someone. please. help dvorak find his meds. hes lost them again resulting in yet another shock-value crackpot  theory article that i chose not to link to on general principle. this time around dvorak has once again put inaccurate  facts on the table and drudged up baseless speculation that apple could - and already is - dropping mac os x to simply  run windows on their macs.no that wasnt a typo. dvorak thinks apple is going to trash mac os x for  windows in what could be andquot;the most phenomenal turnabout in the history of desktop computingandquot;  whatever thats supposed to mean search for the article at pc magazine if you  really want to read it. most of his evidence is based on claims that no ones switching over to the mac despite all  of apples buzz over the last couple years and the disputed andquot;ipod halo effect.andquot; apparently john didnt  notice that apple doubled its u.s. market  share last year to 6.6%. while that isnt a monumental number the fact that it doubled in barely a year is a  significant factor i think john simply missed in what im sure was highly methodical research. lets also not forget  that dell more or less asked apple if they could sell os  x on their computers - what better way to cut down on customer service expenses?the rest of his argument  cites apple dropping firewire in the ipod apples switch to intel and the fact that large vendors like adobe werent  ready when the new intel machines landed. it seems that through his impeccable research dvorak also missed previous  discussion about firewire and its high-bandwidth largely pro purpose as well as the ipods mass-market target. lets  also not forget that adobe cant simply flip a switch and make  cs hop over to the intel side of the mac cpu fence.poking holes in dvoraks ideas aside im starting to  wonder if his articles are becoming not much more than thickly-veiled calls for help. clearly hes beginning to lose  it and i wonder if hes just having a hard time asking for the help he so clearly needs. whos up for a andquot;save  john c. dvorakandquot; fund-raiser?[thanks david anasco. image courtesy of john c. dvoraks wikipedia entry] ,2158,3,29,53, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/dvorak-off-his-meds-claims-apple-switching-to-windows/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/dvorak-off-his-meds-claims-apple-switching-to-windows/,,,

iweb update simplifies urls ,Feb 16 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,ilife:&:software:&:odds and ends , the ilife  updates apple released yesterday  fixed a gripe some users including myself had  with the new url scheme that iweb employed. with its original release an iweb sites url was  http://web.mac.com/username/iweb/. leaving that last /iweb/ off the url would result in a 404 error. while this isnt a  big deal to some its just one extra quirky name to add to a url. to those unfamiliar with the internets  however .mac and iweb could mess up resulting in that exponentially increasing frustration that usually leads to  users simply giving up on the endeavor.after installing the 1.0.1 update last night and making changes to  some of my iweb pages i was pleased to see the url in the andquot;announce your siteandquot; confirmation window chopped  down to simply http://web.mac.com/username. this not only makes the url a little easier to remember and pass around it  also adds a bit more credibility to the url especially over the previous http://homepage.mac.com/username scheme. ,988,2,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/iweb-update-simplifies-ulrs/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/iweb-update-simplifies-ulrs/,,,

tuaw tip: cancel stuff ,Feb 17 2006 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,tuaw tip , no im not talking about hitting the cancel button. im  also not talking about hitting esc. im talking about canceling operations. ever had a page take forever to load and  you just want safari to cut it out? you dont really want to close the window just stop loading whatever wacky css  business was loading. hitting cmd-period thats the apple and the . key will stop whatever active process is going  usually its indicated by a little blue progress bar. for instance if youve ever gone to andquot;save for web...andquot;  in photoshop but the image was enormous that preview can take a minute to load. you can cancel this resize and then  preview all without leaving the save for web interface window. using escape would have canceled the save so cmd-period  has a little niche use here. cmd-period does cancel things at times in finder and andquot;standardandquot; ui dialog boxes  where you have a cancel or ok option. its been around forever as i remember cancelling things all the time on my  dads se/30andmdash; mostly because im an impatient snot. for added fun cmd-period will open the cd tray when youre in  open firmware. ,1133,0,1,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/17/tuaw-tip-cancel-stuff/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/17/tuaw-tip-cancel-stuff/,,

tuaw tip: customize the finderand#039;s toolbar, too ,Feb 20 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,os:&:tuaw tip , dave caolo showed you how to take control of the finders sidebar a  couple weeks back. today i wanted to shed the same light on the finders toolbar as you can customize it and add some  tools not found in a default mac os x installation.the first thing i like to do is add other kinds of  folders and files up there such as my library that i dont necessarily want in my sidebar. to do this you can drag  a file or folder up next to the buttons in the finder and wait a second - you wont receive instantaneous feedback like  you do when adding something to the sidebar. after a second or so the finders search box will move over farther to the  right like when you add something to the dock signifying that you can now add that item to the toolbar.you can also add a few more tools to the finder toolbar by right-clicking on it just like many other application  windows and choosing andquot;customize toolbar.andquot; you will be presented with a whole set of handy buttons and  actions you can drag and drop to add such as eject get info connect to server burn and more. even though we covered  how to get a file or folders  path by command-clicking on a windows title bar icon i also like to add the path button to the finders toolbar  with this trick for one more level of convenience.since im willing to bet that i havent covered all the  finder toolbar tricks feel free to share yours in the comments. ,1407,1,0,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/20/tuaw-tip-customize-the-finders-toolbar-too/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/20/tuaw-tip-customize-the-finders-toolbar-too/,,

apache and php on a mac ,Feb 20 2006 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,how-tos:&:freeware:&:internet tools:&:open source , one of the very first cool things i  learned about the guts of os x was the existence of apache an industrial-strength web server built in to the os.  oreilly has a nice piece on getting started with  apache so start there if youre new to web serving on your mac. imagine hosting your own pages for your own home  intranet. now take that one step further and imagine dynamic pages ones capable of accessing data from the web or  your machine on your home network or using dyndns anywhere.im going to  point out a few resources for getting started using apache and php on your mac. youll find the combination powerful  and getting up to speed is relatively simple. theres some programming involved so if youre scared of that sort of  thing check out how to think like a computer scientist:  learning with python. granted youll be learning python but guess what? you can use python on your mac as well. python goes beyondandnbsp; web programming and is a great  language to get familiar with. if you want to learn php check out webmonkeys php section or w3 schools php intro.apple has a page on getting php working on your mac. its a nice article  too with a step-by-step building of a page to view your itunes library complete with plenty of xml goodness as well.  the problem here is the version of php that comes with your mac is generally a version behind the current release.  while php 4.3 was nice version 5 adds some great stuff. the version of apache shipping with your mac probably isnt  the latest rev of that either so check out phpmacs tutorial on installing apache 2.20 and php 5.1.2. its only for os x version  10.4.4 but itll still work with 10.4.5 no warranty expressed or implied back up your data etc.. once  you have more current versions up and running try out some of those programming resources and try building apps. i  think youll find while apache keeps your mac acting like a great web page server php can turn your private pages into  real network apps. whats really great about setting up php on your mac isnt just a home network but being able to  build and test web apps too all from the comfort of your favorite os. ,2147,3,3,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/20/apache-and-php-on-a-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/20/apache-and-php-on-a-mac/,,

why no windows on macintel? $12,0,Feb 22 2006 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:hacks:&:cult of mac:&:blogging , its an interesting and logical theory. you know that contest to see who can get  windows to run on an intel-based macs? according to the osx86  project that very contest is the reason we arent all dual-booting right now. one argument for open source is that  collaboration breeds potentially betterandnbsp; or at least faster results than working in isolation. so this contest has  stopped the information sharing and developers are guarding their tricks so they can win the money. now obviously were  all looking forward to q or virtual pc just doing  everything in emulation. i want something like wine so i can use exposandeacute; to see outlook and ie6 alongside all my  mac apps not virtualized inside some other os window... but thats just me. and i tend to agree that we arent  installing windows on macintels because in part people are working alone. i still dont see whats to stop someone  with real money like a software company from ignoring the $12000 and developing a tool to install windows on a mac.  i guess this will all be a moot point once the first person has done it. as long as the method and/or tool is available  online im all for it.

macbook pro: inconsistent backlight, hissing lcd [updated x3] ,Feb 22 2006 12:00AM,dan pourhadi,macbook pro , im  almost done with my answer-your-questions macbook pro review. but before i post that i thought it was appropriate to  inform you of what appear to be rev. a glitches in most macbook pro models ive tested:the bottom of the  lcd is noticeably brighter than the rest of the display with a translucent white stripe no affiliation to the band  stretching from one end to the other. also at the back of the bottom of the display near the vent area there seems  to be a high-pitched hissing noise presumably ? emanating from the lcd as the sound is consistent from one end of  the lid to the other.everyone i spoke with who bought one of these new laptops also has these problems  and so did all the macbook pros at my local apple store.reader input time: if you have one of these  suckers are you experiencing the same lcd-inconsistency/hissy noise problems?click on to see a semi-poor  quality image of the problem.update: reader paul makes an interesting observation: the  high-pitched hissing noise despite the consistent volume around the edge of the machine seems to be coming from under  the keyboard. and when the hard drive spins up to perform a task it stops. im still testing this but if the  observation is apt then that would mean the noise is hard drive-related and not the lcd as originally thought.update 2: ok this just gets more thrilling: a hardware guru tells me that  the hard drive is in the front-left of the machine not the back by the noise which means this is probably not a hard  drive issue and could very well be the fan. or the gpu. or the cpu. or even the speakers. anyone else with any  technical insights?update 3: well for me and probably for most of you too the noise  problem is the processor: i installed apples chud tools located on the included os x disk with the xcode installer  and found in the new processor preference pane that when i disabled the core duos second core the high-pitched  hissing noise went away. a troubling problem for sure but if the noise is really that bad for you you could always  enable the processor menu item and just turn off the second core when you dont need it. ,2134,0,20,131, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/22/macbook-pro-inconsistent-backlight-hissing-lcd/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/22/macbook-pro-inconsistent-backlight-hissing-lcd/,,

more words from woz ,Feb 23 2006 12:00AM,dave caolo,apple corporate:&:cult of mac , its always  interesting when steve wozniak speaks about apple. he recently chatted with the globe and mail  following a polo match on segways in new zealand why does this not surprise me?. when asked about apples move to  intel chips woz said it felt like andquot;...consorting with the enemy.andquot; from the article:andquot;...weve had this long history of saying the enemy is the big black-hatted guys and they kind of represent  evil. we are different and by being different were better. all of a sudden were the same in this hardware regard so  its a little hard to swallow your words from the past.andquot;he also stated that a separate ipod  division should be spun off of apple since the hardware os and chips are different. i guess this makes sense.i feel that a chip is a chip is a chip and i dont care if theres a motorola ibm or intel processor inside  my mac. but of course i have much less invested in apple than woz does. plus ive never played polo via horse  or segway.[via macdailynews] ,1006,0,1,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/23/more-words-from-woz/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/23/more-words-from-woz/,,,
powerlogix problems: overheating and kernel panics ,Feb 23 2006 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,how-tos:&:troubleshooting , if you have upgraded your mac using my semi-cracky  how-to you may have also upgraded your powerlogix cpu director  software as time went along. recently i updated to cpu director 2.3b2 and when the drop down menu in system  preferences andgt; energy saver andgt; options andgt; processor performance disappeared i was worried. my cpu was no longer  dynamically changing speed up and down from 1ghz to 2ghz and was staying solidly at 2ghz.i eventually did  what my father always told me: andquot;when all else fails dig the manual out of the garbage.andquot; i went to the trash  and grabbed the read me first.rtf.the readme for the newest cpu director includes this pithy statement:note: dfs and power management functions require mac os x 10.3.9 or later and require a powerlogix 7447a  cpu card. if you purchased a powerlogix 7447a cpu card prior to july 27 2005 your card requires cpu compatibility  updater which will be sent to existing customers. if you have a powerlogix 7447a cpu card and the thermal pane does  not appear in cpu director or processor performance does not appear in the energy saver system preference you need  the cpu director compatibility updater.i dutifully emailed powerlogix support to ask for the cpu  director compatibility updater. they sent me the program i ran it and system preferences andgt; energy saver andgt;  options andgt; processor performance reappeared. the problem is since this upgrade my machine systematically overheats  when i tell it to choose processor performance: automatic. my g4 has not had problems this bad and subsequently caused  kernel panics since the update to  10.4.3. the ultimate solution to this problem would be dynamic cpu switching but also failsafe  temperature monitoring that allowed cpu director to force the computer down to the lower speed if overheating becomes  imminent. apparently this exists for some of the powerlogix cpus but it sure doesnt show up in my cpu director  software i have the powerlogix 7447a.there has been no word yet from powerlogix about this issue and im going to have to step back in cpu director versions. hopefully the cpu director compatibility updater  wont make my setup incompatible with previous version of cpu director. if anyone else has had similar issues and/or has  a solution feel free to post in the comments. ,2329,2,0,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/23/powerlogix-problems-overheating-and-kernel-panics/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/23/powerlogix-problems-overheating-and-kernel-panics/,,,

ipillow: squishiness* for ipod cuddling ,Feb 27 2006 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,accessories:&:ipod family , when i think of battery powered speakers for the ipod i usually  picture a white plastic molded dock-type accessory but apparently there is a market for cuddlier options. one such  example is brookstones ipillow portable mp3 speakers pictured here with a creative mp3 player but compatible via mini  jack with any mp3 player. this device takes six d batteries which probably means it can pump quite some volume in that  huggable housing. be careful not to use the ipillow in an ipillow fight because the mesh pocket doesnt offer much  padding for that ipod of yours!  the ipillow is only available in silver but frankly in the picture here  it looks blue to me.[via popgadget]  [*squishiness is not a real word] ,713,1,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/27/ipillow-squishyness-for-ipod-cuddling/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/27/ipillow-squishyness-for-ipod-cuddling/,,,

apple announces ipod hi-fi ,Feb 28 2006 12:00AM,jan kabili,accessories:&:ipod family:&:other events , apple announced the new ipod hi-fi at this mornings special event. while its not  terrifically exciting its an alternative albeit a pricey one at $349 to third party ipod speakers. the hi-fi  features a universal dock into which you can slide your ipod and another spot on the back for an ipod shuffle. if  youve got an ipod model without a dock connector youll have to buy a separate audio cable to integrate your ipod  with the hi-fi.the ipod nano and the ipod with video will display a new speakers menu for the ipod hi-fi.  the menu will let you control tone with settings like normal treble boost and bass boost display large album art  on the ipod while the hi-fi is playing and set the ipod backlight to remain on so you can see the album art. sorry  but apparently there wont be a speakers menu or tone control for older ipods.theoretically the hi-fi is  portable. it will run on six d-cell batteries andquot;for several hoursandquot; according to steve. however the size and  rectangular design of the hi-fi makes it look like it will be awkward to haul around. its about as big as a breadbox:  17andquot; x 6.6andquot; x 6.9andquot;andnbsp; with hand grips built into the plastic shell.  the hi-fi will charge  your ipod while youre playing music. it includes an apple remote to control music playback from across the room. and  its got a combined analog and digital optical input jack so you can connect it to your computer or to an airport  express to use as a speaker system for those devices. however the requisite audio cable is a separate purchase which  is too bad.im no sound expert but i can tell you that steve was hyping the sound quality of the ipod  hi-fi during the announcement and the apple site touts the hi-fis sound quality across a range of frequencies. its  got two 80 mm speaker cones in dedicated chambers and a 130 mm woofer for bass tones.to be honest im not  likely to run out and buy this updated boombox. im happy with my logitech mm50 portable ipod speaker for now. have you  got a big check left over from the holidays that youre just itching to spend? will you spend it on this? ,2121,0,2,36, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/28/apple-announces-ipod-hi-fi/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/28/apple-announces-ipod-hi-fi/,,,

wikipedia on your ipod ,Feb 28 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,ipod family:&:cool tools:&:education , way back in 1993 i can remember purchasing the entire works of shakespeare on a cd-rom to help me in a college  course i was taking. i also had the printed works but the cd-rom allowed me to do keyword or character searches in a  way the printed text didnt. for me it was a breakthrough in how i was using computers to access content in a  different way. the cd-rom was accessible with hyper-links to other content on the disc which is notable because before  the world wide web hyper-links were really only being used in content like this shakespeare cd-rom and in hyperstudio  and hypercard projects. it was my experience with this cd-rom and gophering into the university of minnesotas system  to study 1990 census data that opened my eyes to the coming world wide web explosion.my point is that while  content doesnt actually change much over the years the way in which we access it does. and today ive learned of yet  another interesting way we access content. you can now get  the wikipedia on your ipod. [note: this requires you to install linux on your ipod].the wikipedia is the free online open-source encyclopedia. ive  been consulting it for years particularly for entries that likely wouldnt appear in a traditional encyclopedia. since  wikipedia content is all user-contributed it tends to be significantly more up-to-date than traditional sources. some  people worry about the accuracy of the wikipedias content but ive never found it to be a problem. ,1468,1,6,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/28/wikipedia-on-your-ipod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/28/wikipedia-on-your-ipod/,,,

in defense of appleand#039;s announcments ,Mar 1 2006 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,analysis / opinion:&:ipod family:&:other events:&:mac mini , apple doesnt need me to defend them and this post isnt going to be a typical apple fanboy defense. some of my  fellow bloggers namely jan damien and c.k. were  unimpressed by the mini-stevenote yesterday and i was right there with them. now after taking some time to digest  just what was introduced i am far from disappointed though i wont be getting a $99 ipod case.if you take at  face value the products announced yesterday no doubt you would be bummed that there wasnt more stuff even though  apple never claimed that this was going to be a boffo announcement. however if you look at the story that the products  tell then things begin to make a little more sense.as i see it apple was telling two stories yesterday:  intel and ipod accessories. lets looks at each of them in turn.the switch to intelas of yesterday as steve pointed out 50% of apples computer product line has made the transition to intel  and in less than 60 days. this is amazing and i am quite puzzled by people who say well the new mac mini isnt that  much different. it has an intel chip in it for goodness sake.part of the blame for this attitude towards  the switch can be attributed to apples great handling of it. they have made a conscious decision not to introduce new  styles of macs to mark the intel transition. what does this mean? if you put an intel mac mini next to a power pc mac  mini most people wont be able to tell the difference though the ir port is a dead give away. why do this? because  the manufacturer of the chip shouldnt matter to the everyday user. a mac is a mac whether it is running on a g5 a  core duo or a dorito. however by making this transition look so easy when in fact it isnt from an engineering point  of view apple is encouraging people to say what?! nothing is new with the mac mini... well other than front row and a  complete change in system architecture.. but other than that nothing!the big yawn that the intel mac mini  produced unjustly i think just proves that apple is managing the intel transition much better than anyone thought  possible.apples entry into the ipod economythe ipod hi-fi is less of a product and more a signal to the belkins and the  griffin technologies of the world. apple is saying andquot;there is a billion dollar ipod economy out there that we  created and we want a piece of the action. if i were in charge of ipod products for any third party company i would be  very nervous about this.this serious interest in ipod accessories was of course first seen at macworld  were apple announced their new remote control/radio receiver for the ipod. that product and the hi-fi take advantage  of apples control over the ipod to make interaction between the ipod and the accessory exceedingly smooth. with a  software update apple added a special menu item for the hi-fi on every ipod that is compatible with the product and  that has a screen. no other vendor can assure that their products will work as well with the ipod and i am sure they  arent happy about it.i expect to see more ipod accessories from apple in the coming months and i expect  that they will sell well based on the fact that apple is making them and not some company the average joe may not have  heard of and they will make apple a tidy sum of money.conclusionso as you can  see even though there wasnt an ipod video with touch screen controls or feature length films in itunes this  announcement certainly was interesting. ,3444,1,6,40, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/01/in-defense-of-apples-announcments/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/01/in-defense-of-apples-announcments/,,,
who knew that the new movies in the itms would *really* be yesterdayand#039;s big news? ,Mar 1 2006 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,analysis / opinion:&:its:&:peripherals:&:video:&:other events:&:mac mini , yesterday morning i posted a  prediction that proved incorrect. apple didnt announce movies in the itms to be the big announcement of the day.  nevertheless i feel that the academy award nominated short films appearing in the itms yesterday actually ended up  being the biggest news of the day. as i noted yesterday its the first appearance of non-pixar/disney shorts in the  music store so it paves the way for more great content although all of the films are presented by the sundance  channel so it is kind of like another tv network releasing shows on the itms.as for all the other  announcements from yesterday i can sum them all upandmdash;explain why they are all dud announcementsandmdash;in one  simple word: overpriced. $1.99 for the new short films in the itms is a bargain. everything else was overpriced.  overpriced like the $99 leather ipod cases that dont actually provide the user with any access to the controls of the  ipod. overpriced like the $349 boombox that still needs the addition of a $300 ipod to make it as cool as it can be  and even then it is not that cool; i mean hi-fi is a 70s term and the boombox is an 80s device; how is this  expensive ipod peripheral indicative of apples innovation?. overpriced like the $599 and $799 mac minis. one of the  great things about apples mac mini line should be its affordability and yesterday we saw little value added to the  mac mini line and yet the most expensive one of them runs just fourfive hundred less than the faster  imac line that lacks the need to provide your own screen keyboard and mouse. i mean what was added? the expected  shift from powerpc to intel processors? the fastest they offer in the mini is still only 1.67ghz. the apple remote? if  its so much simpler than all the other remotes i own then how come it alone is priced at more than any of those  full-featured remotes? the new bonjour-savvy front row? well that is cool but all macs with front row will be getting  this feature so i dont think it warrants the attention especially when nothing really innovative has been done with  the new mini to make it an effective media center. sure it can work with an hdtv but wheres the  built-in pvr? i mean if you want to pipe your hdtv digital cable connection into the mini you are still going to need  to spend a couple of hundred dollars on something like an eyetv. i dont see any hdmi / dvi in on that new expensive  mini.i like jan am under-whelmed by yesterdays  announcements and i agree with damien that apple clearly dropped the ball and  our disappointment is not the creation of our fanaticism but rather apples failure to live up to the innovation weve  come to expect from them. ,2687,0,4,43, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/01/who-knew-that-the-new-movies-in-the-itms-would-really-be-yeste/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/01/who-knew-that-the-new-movies-in-the-itms-would-really-be-yeste/,,
in defense of the apple rumor-mongering ,Mar 1 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:rumors:&:other events:&:apple , so apples event  today is being viewed by a lot of people as a major letdown and the response from many is along the lines of:andquot;well its your own fault. you shouldnt have hyped the event and posted fake mockups of products.  its not apples fault that they didnt release products they never said theyd release...andquot;andnbsp; etc.  etc.but heres the problem with that argument. most of us that are being critical of apple today are being  critical of the products themselves. were more disappointed in an ugly andquot;hi-fiandquot; boombox that lacks  many of the most basic features of a standard boombox than we are about apple not releasing a tablet or new video ipod.  were disappointed that apple a company renowned for its innovative products would release a product thats  so...well...not innovative. its an overly expensive pod dock with speakers. it doesnt even sport the one feature that  would truly make it unique--a wi-fi connection to make it interact with wireless streaming music.the intel  mac minis are a little better but were not happy about the price increase. apple wants to market the mini as both an  entertainment center and an entry-level mac but is pricing it out of the accepted range for either market. not to  mention that its lacking crucial features required by both markets. any decent media center will have pvr  capabilities which this does not without attaching a product like el gatos eyetv 500. and the integrated graphics  chip in this thing is going to make it a poor candidate for pc switchers who are expecting at least reasonable graphics  performance. real world tests will eventually prove whether the supposedly new and speedy intel chips will be able to  compensate for the lackluster video capabilities in these models but were not holding our breath.and  dont even get me started on the leather ipod case. one hundred dollars for a protective case for a video ipod that  makes you take the ipod out of the case to watch a video or use the controls? im just as much as an mac fan as the  next apple-logo-wearing guy but this is just ridiculous.that the products released today are underwhelming  isnt the fault of our admittedly overhyped expectations its the fault of the underwhelming products being released.  the bottom line is that apples not being very innovative with these products and we should be allowed to be critical  of them. saying that its the mac fan sites that are at fault for instilling unreasonable expectations just isnt an  argument that holds much water. ,2536,0,21,64, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/01/in-defense-of-the-apple-rumor-mongering/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/01/in-defense-of-the-apple-rumor-mongering/,,,

universal binary status of adobe applications ,Mar 4 2006 12:00AM,jan kabili,software:&:podcasting:&:universal binary , adobe photoshop product manager john nack had this to say  about the universal binary status of adobe applications in an interview with inside mac radio at flash forward 2006  this week. as youve probably heard with the exception of the public beta of adobe lightroom adobe apps are not yet  universal. you can read more excerpts from the interview at the  unofficial photoshop weblog or listen to the interview on the march 2 2006 episode of inside mac radio [ itms link ].nack:andquot;we recognize that to really address the way the markets been changing around digital photography it  wasnt going to be good enough to just keep doing incremental additions to our existing code. what we really need is to  start with a fresh slate. so in the case of lightroom because they did that its been a lot quicker for them to move  to mactel. with some of the more mature apps like photoshop illustrator its a really big project and  theres a lot of work to move the code from code warrior over into xcode get that compiling and then get that  compiling on mactel. so its something where its a long process. i wish we could do it faster. but apples been really  great in supporting that. thereve been apple folks on site all the time over at adobe answering questions bouncing  ideas back and forth. . . both companies really want to see this happen just like users do. well have it out as soon  as we can with the obvious qualifier that we want to right. we dont want to just rush it out there and have it not  work well. so itll take some time but were definitely working closely on it.as we work with apple we  want to make sure that our applications keep evolving and taking really good advantage of all the new innovations  theyve got. they came out with the dual processor dual core g5s. theyre making some really great changes around the  graphics architecture like with the new macbook--much faster memory systems with their gpu. and so i think that this  evolution will help us stay really current and take good advantage of that. and of course every time a new system comes  out one of the key benchmarks is how fast does it run photoshop. and so its in everybodys interest to make sure that  our apps really shine on the new boxes.andquot; ,2245,0,6,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/04/universal-binary-status-of-adobe-applications/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/04/universal-binary-status-of-adobe-applications/,,,

sweet deal on upgrade to universal version of final cut studio ,Mar 4 2006 12:00AM,jan kabili,software update:&:universal binary , apple is offering a deal on the  universal version of final cut studio that could save you big bucks. if you have a standalone version of either final  cut pro soundtrack pro motion or dvd studio pro you can exchange your disk and a relatively small amount of cash  for the universal version of the complete final cut studio package.final cut studio includes all four of  those professional apps--a package that would normally run you $1299.andnbsp; if for example you have final cut pro 4  or hd 4.5 you can upgrade to the whole studio for $199. if you have final cut pro 5 you can upgrade for just $99.  the magnitude of those discounts puts final cut studio in the ballpark for some of us who were making due with one of  the apps but had not considered purchasing the expensive studio package.the deal varies depending on which  standalone app or package you already own or can get your hands on. you can find all the permutations here at the apple site. if youre not sure if your version is  included in the promotion check the fine print on the appropriate upgrade form which you can download from the same page. for example the fine print on the  final cut 4 / hd form seems to say that you can participate in the promotion even if your fcp 4 or fcp hd standalone  disk is an academic version or an upgrade disk. there are also crossgrades from logic pro 7 logic pro express and  final cut studio pro but this promotion does not cover final cut express or shake.you may have have shied  away from these expensive professional apps in the past but if youre interested in joining the podcast / vodcast  craze this promotion may be your ticket. the catch is that you have to send in your old disk. now if you could just  remember where you stashed it. ,1757,0,3,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/04/sweet-deal-on-upgrade-to-universal-version-of-final-cut-studio/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/04/sweet-deal-on-upgrade-to-universal-version-of-final-cut-studio/,,,

mac mini core solo: first impressions ,Mar 5 2006 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,  , it may  surprise you based on my initial and following  response to the news of the new mac mini that i acquired one for myself.my initial reactions were  largely in response to the elevated price of the entry level model in comparison to the new features offered.  nevertheless i like the mini as a development box to run odd experiments on so i placed my hands on a mac mini core  solo this weekend. this initial post will be my first impressions of the device after having toyed with it for the  better half of a day. i can sum up the experience in one easy to understand sentence: im considering taking it back  before the apple stores 14 day return period expires.there are  several little oddities and one big problem that are making me think that either i got a dud or apple let this little  mac out into the wild a bit too soon. if you look at the picture accompanying this post youll see the mac mini  doesnt fully comprehend what it is. it thinks it is an 1.5ghz core duo in the about this mac panel but the system  profiler pictured to with this paragraph knows the secret truth. this could be a very minimal glitch and not  something over which to return the machine but if you read on after the break youll see more reason including front  row performance that is much below what any of us i think expected.more after the break... ,1345,0,19,56, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/05/mac-mini-core-solo-first-impressions/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/05/mac-mini-core-solo-first-impressions/,,

why doesnand#039;t the front row remote have a click wheel? ,Mar 5 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:mac mini , as i was writing up  my previous post about a designtechnica article praising the front row remote for its  simplicity and ipod-like ease of use a question came to mind: if the front row remote is another extension of  apples easy-to-use ideals why doesnt it posses a click wheel? that round white circle is one of the  ipods design fundamentals that has brought the device into so many households and pockets. more importantly its also  just about the best darn ui for browsing through massive amounts of media - and isnt that what front row is designed to  do? i see front row as apples andquot;ipod for the living room.andquot; it is a really really simple piece of software  that wrangles all our content just like the ipod together for our viewing and listening pleasure in just  about any room we want. from this perspective i wonder if apple dropped the ball on the remotes design.  dont get me wrong i really like the remote especially in comparison to its competitors and im excited to one day  afford a mac mini for our living room. i just think it would be so much cooler if we could have a click wheel  to  control nearly all the media we have on our computers. apple could easily have made the remote the size of something  like the ipod nano which would still give it that andquot;amazingly smallandquot; aura as well as room to fit a click  wheel and maybe even save some production costs. a click wheel front row remote would make it even easier to browse  through the zillions of songs videos and photos that people can now access from the comforts of their couch. lastly i  think it would even help apple to further the ipod brand as users could now have the same ui on one of their home  remotes as they have on the music player in their pockets.*sigh* its too bad apple didnt give me a call  when kicking around ideas for the remote. maybe ill get lucky with the 2.0 redesign version some day. something tells  me however that i shouldnt hold my breath. ,1975,0,3,23, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/05/why-doesnt-the-front-row-remote-have-a-click-wheel/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/05/why-doesnt-the-front-row-remote-have-a-click-wheel/,,,

nnw unread menu ,Mar 6 2006 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,software:&:universal binary , i  like netnewswire so it stands to reason that ill like any  software that extends nnw and thats just what nnw unread  menu does.more specifically it displays a menu item with your unread items count and if you click on  the menu item you get a menu with the blog name and the number of unread posts.thats pretty cool but the  best feature is that the application supports growl. each new post  will spawn a growl notification which isnt a problem if you subscribe to a normal amount of blogs but if youre like  me and have something like 700 subscriptions it can take awhile for each item to pop up.nnw unread menu is  universal and freeware. ,646,3,1,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/06/nnw-unread-menu/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/06/nnw-unread-menu/,,,

mac mini core solo: not a good switcher machine ,Mar 6 2006 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,analysis / opinion:&:switchers:&:mac mini , im  getting a lot of comments on last nights  review of the mac mini core solo and a lot of mac faithful are saying that the review is too harsh that im being  too negative and that the majority of the problems would appear to be software glitches not hardware. they wonder why  i am currently panning the device in my review.allow me to offer a very simple rebuttal that i think  justifies my negative review. the mac mini since its introduction has been the machine most clearly aimed at  switchers. its a small supposedly inexpensive computer sans keyboard mouse and screen that any windows user can  buy as their starter mac. now lets overlook for a moment that in windows land $600 for a 1.5ghz processor and a 80gb  hard drive is by no means a steal. if you were a first time mac user who had long heard the marvels of mac the  stability of os x and had finally gone to purchase one hearing from all your friends that it would be a paradise of  no crashes no bugs that it would just work compared to your crashtastic windows machine wouldnt you be inclined to  return it if you encountered all the little glitches ive encountered over the past 24 hours? i honestly  think that if a substantial number of other mac mini users are encountering the same problems that i have been  encountering that releasing the machine at this price point and with these problems could in the long run prove to be  a huge marketing mistake on apples part. ,1445,1,2,27, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/06/mac-mini-core-solo-not-a-good-switcher-machine/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/06/mac-mini-core-solo-not-a-good-switcher-machine/,,

univ. of wisc. madison mac os x security challenge update ,Mar 7 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,  , if you  remember mac sysadmin at university of wisconsin madison dave schroeder set up a  mac mini as a type of honeypot to challenge the  andquot;hackingandquot; community to see if anyone could compromise a mac os x 10.4.5 system. the mac mini in question was  set up as an andquot;out-of-the-boxandquot; system with apples security updates applied and he turned on both ssh and  apache two common internet services but not ones that the average mac os x user would ever enable.initially the contest was set to end on friday march 10th after which he would publish the details of his  experiment. however checking the site this evening i see that hes scheduled  it to end tonight at midnight central time. dave schroeder also says that andquot;the machine is under intermittent dos attack. most of the other traffic aside from  casual web visitors is web exploit scripts ssh dictionary  attacks and scanning tools such as nessus.andquot;has the box been compromised? he  doesnt say but he will be publishing the results of the experiment probably tomorrow. im very interested and  intrigued to read what the end result will be even if it the news isnt good i.e. the machine was actually  compromised. whatever the results its sure to be a better analysis of mac os x security than the misleading and poorly-designed example  making the news rounds yesterday. ,1362,4,1,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/univ-of-wisc-madison-mac-os-x-security-challenge-update/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/univ-of-wisc-madison-mac-os-x-security-challenge-update/,,,

analyzing mac tco ,Mar 7 2006 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:enterprise:&:cult of mac , want an easy way to start a holy war? aside from putting a major  holy city from three major religions together in one convenient location the easiest thing to do is start talking about  the nebulous and nefarious tco or total cost of ownership.  lets face it apple faithful are going to have  their end of the argument stuff like macs are made for graphics and the windows faithful are going to have theirs  photoshop starts up faster on a pc. and then theres linux where gif is pronounced jif thats a joke no flames  just yet please. winn schwartau has made his  stand like it or not. he says macs are cheaper overall once youve accounted for all the stuff you have to do  with a computer not just the initial cost of buying one. because as we all know pcs from dell are always cheaper.  you know i have purchased three different home theater systems lately and all of them were cheaper than bose or  sonyandmdash; and all of them died within one day of the box being opened. so dont go talking to me about purchase  price...anyway winn not only makes a compelling case stating the obvious andquot;most enterprises do not  want users installing software on their machines - they want a box to run mail client and browser and a couple of  office applicationsandquot; and the obscure andquot;owning a wintel box for three years costs twice as much as owning a  mactel.andquot; better still back in september of 2005 winn posted his tco analysis  spreadsheet and pdf which wil walk anyone through the same process of calculations he used and can be applied to  virtually any system. naturally a holy war erupted on his blog. read through the comments for a ton of fun or just  work the numbers yourself. or you can give up and call it a draw as james maguire did in 2003. really he said what were all  thinking: apple stuff costs more but makes for less headaches in general and thats the bottom line for small to  mid-sized businesses. apples low cost pitch can be found here. ,1978,0,2,13, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/analyzing-mac-tco/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/analyzing-mac-tco/,,

how to take mac security seriously ,Mar 7 2006 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,analysis / opinion:&:os:&:tips and tricks:&:odds and ends:&:internet , damien went into detail about the andquot;hacker  challengeandquot; story and as he explained its much ado about nothingandmdash; for now. clearly this mac security  thing is only going to get more important. even headline news had a largely exaggerated report on the bluetooth exploit  found a while ago... so what is the average mac user supposed to do? its all well and good if youre a sysadmin and you  can do stuff like lock down a server but if you just bought your ibook and you are now cowering in a corner because  youre afraid to even open the thing knowing that you will automatically andquot;catchandquot; something what then? read  on as i have some stories and advice for you.first it is important to note that the most likely vector of any computer attack is human. and keep in mind the  difference between a vector of attack like the ssh andquot;hackandquot; mentioned by damien and a payload which would  be a true virus or trojan. a worm is a vector but it might deploy a payload. make sense? anyway the point is humans  are the weakest link in the whole chain yet also the most important in stopping any attack. it is this central fact  that makes almost all oses equal in terms of security. you are only as good as the people who use a system and those  who set it up. case in point: phishing.phishing is a  huge problem and easy to set up. you get an email claiming some guy is your long-lost relative and he needs some  money to get out of jail. if he gets out hell double your money. or even easier to trick but harder to set up is  the fake url scam where it looks like paypal or ebay common targets is sending you a letter about your account. this  is the true phishing scenario played out millions of times a day on the internet. just click on the link to  andquot;verifyandquot; your account info or it will be deleted. unfortunately the link will take you to a spoofed site  and youll be typing your sensitive info into a trap designed to steal your passwords and credit card numbers. these  are spins on classic grifters tricks and phishing scams arent very well guarded on os x. microsoft and mozilla are  trying to attack this problem with tools in their browsers or in email clients that will alert you to spoofed  websites. so what can you do on os x? first check out the us governments guide to avoiding phishing  scams. second make sure youre using something to filter spam as this will often catch a lot of generic phishing  scams. if you use firefox netcraft has a toolbar that will supposedly guard  against phishing but i havent tried it. it essentially checks urls for you. third use common sense. would ebay  really send out an email to an account and not use their username? of course the common sense cure is the hardest one  to invoke...one more thing about the human vector: its all about education. you have to teach people the  rules of the road yes? well youll have to educate yourself or others on some basic security precautions especially  if you are the cautious type. one common concept is to never share passwords. also most people would recommend you  dont use the same password for everything you do. and since were talking about passwords dont forget to change them  often and use combos of letters numbers and uppercase/lowercase where appropriate. if you want a freeware tool for  making passwords theres pazzle. with keychain i have a  bad good habit of just setting a great password but instantly forgetting it. lets just hope i back  up my keychain database on a regular basis eh? oddly enough wayne state has a quick little ditty on setting passwords and of course wikipedia has the  whole history plus some ideas too. without exposing my own tricks  i can say that if i have to remember it im more likely to use l33t type spelling for relatively common stuff. maybe  not the most secure in the world but more secure than andquot;fluffyandquot; or andquot;philton.andquot; and did you know os x  includes a password helper to help create good passwords? its all here on this tiger tips page. essentially you click the  little questi,4731,5,7,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/how-to-take-mac-security-seriously/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/how-to-take-mac-security-seriously/,,

dobry backuper ,Mar 7 2006 12:00AM,victor agreda, jr.,software:&:cool tools , we can argue the spelling of backuper all day but lets  just ignore the rules of english for the time being and get down to the application at hand: dobry backuper. it appears the hole left by  retrospect is being filled by ever more capable applications and dobrys solution looks like a great one for home  users. in fact this program is really geared towards the home user who is often tasked with keeping backups for a  couple computers or 4 as in my case. backuper allows you to make full backups replacing old with new in one big  chunk versioned keeps older versions intact or incremental my favorite where new or changed stuff is uploaded  over the old but anything that didnt change stays there. in summary: dobry backuper is similar to .macs backup  except it offers more flexibility. some downsides exist however as you wont be able to administer  backups from afar. also youll have to create an individual backup scheme for each machine only local home folders  can be backed up. but overall i think this is an excellent alternative to something like retrospect which i just  never bothered to update after os x pretty much smashed it to pieces.[via apple matters] ,1177,0,0,13, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/dobry-backuper/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/dobry-backuper/,,
delicious vs. .mac bookmark syncing ,Mar 7 2006 12:00AM,dave caolo,internet:&:internet tools , dave  chartier and i were talking about del.icio.us earlier today in the secret tuaw offices in reese witherspoons guest  house. he loves delicious and i had never used it. for years now ive been happily chugging along with .macs  bookmark syncing feature and my own organization of the bookmark bar. yet at daves suggestion i gave delicious a  try. after installing delibar and exporting my  bookmarks with safarilicious i was ready to go.the delicious pros first of all its very easy to add a bookmark. just add the droplet  to your menubar and give it a click. next the tagging is just great. by adding tags to my bookmarks like  andquot;appleandquot; andquot;blogandquot; andquot;dailyandquot; or andquot;familyandquot; i can easily find the site or group of  sites im looking for. the social aspect is also very appealing. if i want to find sites that other users have tagged  as andquot;appleandquot; or andquot;techandquot; thats a snap. finally i have access to my bookmarks from any  internet enabled computer on any operating system. you cant beat that. i can even add bookmarks to my collection from  any of those random machines. sounds great and it is. but im not going to use it. heres why.the  delicious cons this may sound petty but its huge to me. no andquot;open in tabs.andquot; i keep my  bookmarks highly organized and i have several folders that categorize links into andquot;dailyandquot; andquot;appleandquot;  andquot;winandquot; etc. the first thing i do each morning is right-click on the andquot;dailyandquot; folder and select  andquot;open in tabs.andquot; i then move from tab to tab closing ones im not interested in and keeping the good ones  open for more thorough inspection later. while delibar allows for greater organization than a plain old browser does  it wont allow for my andquot;open in tabsandquot; routine. plus it only lets me open one link at a time and each in a  new window! that is totally unacceptable.also im not going to keep a web page open just because it  contains my bookmarks. the bookmark bar was invented to extinguish this annoyance. now i understand that i can  subscribe to delicious rss feeds and thats great but i really like to have my sites open in a series of tabs. its  just my preferred way to work.what i like about .macwell several of the  delicious pros are a part of .macs bookmark sync. i can access my bookmarks from any internet enabled computer by  going to bookmarks.mac.com and i can add a new link to any of the folders i created on my mac at home from the  computer i happen to be using be it a mac a windows machine or what have you. aside from the social aspect of  delicious this is whats most appealing to me. speaking of social bookmarking...what .mac could  learn from deliciousno tagging. once youve created a bunch of tags you miss them when theyre  gone. for highly organized neatnicks like me creating and utilizing tags upon tags is very satisfying. i just dont  get that with safari. also the social aspect of delicious-that is the ability to browse other peoples bookmarks-is  way cool and something that would be a great feature of .mac. id love to see this implemented some day.conclusion delicious is fantastic but it simply doesnt fit my personal style of  working. im not knocking it in any way but i just like to be able to andquot;categorizeandquot; sites as either  andquot;interestingandquot; andquot;follow-upandquot; or andquot;ditch itandquot; on the fly. plus aside from the tagging and  sharing .mac lets me do what i want to do with my bookmarks: access and add to them from any computer. for now at  least im sticking with .mac. ,3642,1,1,16, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/delicious-vs-mac-bookmark-syncing/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/delicious-vs-mac-bookmark-syncing/,,,
another look at mac os x security ,Mar 7 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,analysis / opinion:&:enterprise:&:os:&:tips and tricks:&:apple , i  take security exploits seriously. im responsible for many hundreds of macintosh computers that reside in many  different environments not to mention half-a-dozen x-serves several of which are production boxes open to the world.  when a security exploit is announced i look to see if it will impact my workstations and servers and whether i need to  take immediate action. and with the exception of the recent safari exploit that was patched last week by apples security 2006-001  update there hasnt yet been a single vulnerability that significantly affects my computers operations. [note  reader brent points to a zdnet article  just published a few hours ago that claims apple hasnt adequately fixed the safari exploit in question].so  when an article claiming andquot;mac  os x hacked in less than 30 minutesandquot; popped up on my news radar last night i read through it and quickly  dismissed it as a non-story and a journalistically unsound one at that. neither this article or any of its copycats  up to more than six now has bothered to even attempt to actually explain the andquot;hackandquot; or the  andquot;exploit.andquot; plain and simple folks these articles are full of hype empty of facts and are bunk: ,1225,1,11,14, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/another-look-at-mac-os-x-security/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/07/another-look-at-mac-os-x-security/,,,
quicksilver basics: shake hands with your preferences ,Mar 8 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:cool tools:&:how-tos:&:productivity , yesterday quicksilver started acting a little goofy and i wasnt surprised; i have just about every beta and  extra turned on as i just cant stop exploring all the neat stuff this app can do. during my troubleshooting efforts i  resorted to the simple trick of quitting quicksilver and simply moving its preference file located with other  preference files in ~/library/preferences to my desktop forcing quicksilver to re-create a clean new preference file.  this fixed the issue but it also forced me to dive back into my preferences to tweak toggle and change some of the  options i use to make quicksilver do what i want.that experience made me realize however that part of the  quicksilver learning curve for new users really is to get to know its preferences since they act as a handy springboard  into what quicksilver is capable of. a lot of fantastic tutorials like those at 43 folders and blacktrees own site the makers of quicksilver sometimes  assume that you already know what youre doing with quicksilver. another complication is that the actions and  sometimes plugins used in these tutorials are not installed or enabled by default. some of the email actions - for  example the andquot;send item immediatelyandquot; action that allows you to email an item to someone without ever touching  a mail composition window - are oddly not enabled in a default quicksilver installation which means a user has to open  quicksilvers preferences once invoked a quick cmd -  does the trick and dig around in the actions section to find  what they need. ultimately i figure there are three key areas of quicksilvers preferences that might help new or  aspiring but confused  users get their feet grounded: catalog actions and plugins and here is a brief explanation of  each:        catalog - this is a pretty straight-forward list of everything quicksilver keeps track of on  your mac. looking through the catalog and the actions preference panel should help you get a grasp of what  items quicksilver can find and manipulate and then how you can manipulate them.       actions -  this is a list of the defining ability that separates quicksilver from mere seek-and-find applications. actions allow  you to do something with the item you have found far above and beyond simply opening it. actions are  loosely categorized to help you find your way around: address book actions allow you to do more with your contacts  text actions an optional plugin allow you to do things like looking up word definitions right from within quicksilver  and appending text to a file buried somewhere etc. if this panel doesnt excite your inner productivity geek you  should consider consulting your physician.      plugins - quicksilver is highly highly plugin-able  which is where even more of its beauty radiates from. plugins for backpack alternative browser bookmarks the mac os x  keychain netnewswire headlines a multiple-item clipboard hundreds of web search engines and much much more all have  your name written on them. go wild.    quicksilver is one of the few apps that is so different and powerful  that the classic andquot;just open and play with itandquot; phrase might not be enough for some users to grasp whats going  on. if you are one of these users i hope this brief explanation will help you to take your first step into the wide  wonderful universe of quicksilver. ,3374,0,3,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/08/quicksilver-basics-shake-hands-with-your-preferences/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/08/quicksilver-basics-shake-hands-with-your-preferences/,,,

mac mini core solo: the good stuff and a peek inside ,Mar 8 2006 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,reviews:&:mac mini , despite my previous two posts on the topic there are things to like  about the mac mini and so ive decided not to return the machine. i still think it is overpriced and i also maintain  that the front row performance over bonjour is shoddy at best. however if you keep all your media on the mac mini it  works nicely as a little media server offering the local media up to my tv. my only complaint about that is that front  row doesnt recognize my ipod and the content on it when it is mounted on the mac mini even though i can navigate and  play all that content via itunes itself.i also discovered that the 512mb chip that i ripped out of my imac  when i upgraded it to 2gbs of ram fits quite nicely and works well inside my mac mini which is now running 768mbs of  ram after an easy bit of tinkering  photos of said tinkering after the jump. the added ram has doubled the frame rate at which i can run world of  warcraft on my 32-inch hdtv. its still a bit sluggish at 16-20fps in crowded areas but it is playable and overall a  cool experience while lounging on my couch with wireless bluetooth keyboard in lap and mouse to my side. additionally  using this wonderful little program called irecord i  can hook up my digital cable box to the mini via a firewire cable and record shows in hdtv. unfortunately playing back  these hdtv shows with their large 7.35gb size footprint for an hour of video via vlc seems a little beyond the  capabilities of the mini as the video shows up as an animated series of stills during fast-moving sections. however i  can easily bring these large files over to my imac where i can watch them and compress them to a smaller more mini  friendly format. also as a dev box i am liking the mini. i can jump into it easily enough using chicken of the vnc on  my imac and osxvnc on the mini. i can also ssh in via the command line. compiling code while not blazingly fast isnt  snail-crawl slow either. so im enjoying the box for what i bought it for i just wish it had a core duo came with  more ram bonjour video worked better and it hadnt cost so much. ,2088,2,6,24, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/08/mac-mini-core-solo-the-good-stuff/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/08/mac-mini-core-solo-the-good-stuff/,,

nnw booted from my dock, long live endo! ,Mar 8 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:cool tools:&:internet tools , scott posted on endo yesterday and today i am happy to report  that nnw has gone to that giant andquot;poofandquot; in the ex-dock sky. sure endo has some minor andquot;its a 1.0  releaseandquot; quirks but this is the newsreader ive been waiting for. after putting it through its paces  last night i was happy to dethrone netnewswires place in my dock and heres why.first and foremost is  netnewwires age. version 2.x is old and its starting to feel like it hasnt been touched in a while possibly due to  its dominance in the newsreading market or the newsgator buyout. now i dont mean any disrespect; ranchero is a great  company and netnewswire both initiated me into and carried me through the newsreading market for a couple of years now.  endo simply feels like it pays a little more attention to the market and is aiming to evolve with it as it offers some  really slick integration and headline organizing options. headlines can be added to a del.icio.us account right from  within endo without the need for snarky applescripts that make me leave the app to do the actual bookmarking in a  browser.on the topic of feed management endo is very customizable with the ability to set refresh rates  for each group and/or feed and disabling them altogether and even the ability to colorize particular feeds headlines  so theyre easier to pick out in a crowd. endo also offers a growl-like notification system toggled per feed that  allows you to sift through snippets of new headlines and short summaries while leaving endo minimized or even hidden.  the headline column on the left is also quite tweakable as summaries and tags can be displayed in-line with the  headlines or you can completely turn off both of those items as i have in my screenshot. to round up the feed  management angle: for all those times when you cant get online endo has the ever-obvious andquot;offlineandquot; option. ,1900,1,6,33, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/08/nnw-booted-from-my-dock-long-live-endo/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/08/nnw-booted-from-my-dock-long-live-endo/,,

will there be macs in the year 2010? ,Mar 8 2006 12:00AM,jan kabili,analysis / opinion , will apple still be making computers in the year 2010? chris  seibold at apple matters doesnt think so. he lists five tongue in cheek? reasons  for this provocative conclusion. my favorite is that the supply of cat names is getting low. his other four arguments  are:        microsoft vista - vista aims to enhance its look and its security the two most frequent  complaints about windows xp. vistas mac-like niceties plus beefed-up security will wipe out a lot of the interest in  os x.      apples switch to intel - now that intel is inside both macs and pcs consumers wont buy the line  that macs are technically superior. theyll just go for the cheaper machine.      the ipod - the ipods  revenue-producing powers will entice apple into concentrating its efforts on the ipod and allocating less manpower to  designing computers.      dollars and cents - apples profit margins on macs could be replaced by sales of os  x ilife final cut pro and the companys other software if it makes os x available to run on any capable machine  rather than tying the operating system to macintosh boxes. this move could increase software sales enough to offset  lack of revenue from hardware.    apple matters predicts that when all this comes about mac fans will  andquot;howl and moanandquot; but in the end it will be a good thing for us. yeah and so is cod liver oil but that  doesnt mean we have to take it. ,1403,0,1,30, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/08/will-there-be-macs-in-the-year-2010/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/08/will-there-be-macs-in-the-year-2010/,,,

stop manually maximizing your windows ,Mar 9 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion , this  rant about mac os x multitasking and usability is brought to you by the letter q and a disgruntled design student:i heard something snap in my head today as i sat down at the back of an art history lecture hall where outlets  are i follow and got to peek over the shoulder of a girl using a 15andquot; powerbook in front of me.this  girl was using safari to browse myspace and - arguments about that sites damage to civilization as we know it aside -  the browser window was 100% maximized across her 1280 x 960 display obliterating what i would estimate is at least 1/3  of useful screen real estate. then she switched over to word to keep working on a paper - again word had been manually  maximized across the entirety of her widescreen display which was throwing easily half of her usable screen space into  the garbage. unfortunately she is just one of many i have witnessed throwing away all sorts of useful screen space  while using mac os x.men and women boys and girls please: mac os x more or less offers only one way to  manually maximize windows across your entire display for a reason - because they dont have to be that large.  andquot;multitaskingandquot; is defined as andquot;the simultaneous execution of more than one program or task by a  single computer processor.andquot; if we apply that definition to a persons ability to multitask it means that you  too are able to work on and look at more than one thing at once - which is why mac os x intentionally makes it difficult  for one application to dominate the entirety of your display applications such as firefox that dont obey the mac os  x windowing rules im referring to are exempt from this post.while the various tricks and design ideals  that mac os x uses to accomplish this fantastic feat of productivity-inducing magic are outside the scope of my rant i  just want the word to get out that it is actually safe to trust your operating systems judgments in these kinds of  matters. tell your parents inform you friends. im especially looking at you switchers. i know the way mac os x  handles windows and changing their size is strange but trust me - once you get used to it and wrap your head around  why it works this way on apples side of the fence youll be overjoyed with all the extra screen space you  just reclaimed.so go ahead live on the edge: use that green andquot;best fitandquot; button and the window  andgt; zoom options and be happy that youve taken a positive step towards getting just a little more done on your mac. ,2523,0,6,125, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/09/stop-manually-maximizing-your-windows/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/09/stop-manually-maximizing-your-windows/,,,

apple to outsource tech support to india ,Mar 9 2006 12:00AM,jan kabili,apple corporate , the india times reported today that apple is planning to set up  a massive tech support center in bangalore india its first tech support center outside of cupertino.  the article says that apple will hire 3000 tech support workers in india by 2007 with up to half of those to be hired  this year. property developer rmz corp is allegedly creating a 1.5 lakh sq ft facility  for apple in the first phase and 1.5 lakh sq ft in the second phase. anybody know how big a lakh square foot is?  the buzz generated by this announcement includes concerns about tech support quality. even the most  politically correct among us would admit that deep down we dont relish the thought of stumbling through another tech  support call to an overseas center negotiating barriers of language and accent while trying to unravel computer  problems. the effect of overseas outsourcing on local tech support workers is another concern. what will happen to  apples support center in cupertino?apple declined to comment telling the times that it was premature to  talk about it. however an indian government official told the paper that it had cleared apples investment proposal  and that operations should begin within two months.update: it seems that a lakh is a traditional way to say  100000 so scott our resident units and measures dude thinks that apple is building a 150000 square foot facility  which is also known as freakin huge. ,1418,0,6,58, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/09/apple-to-outsource-tech-support-to-india/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/09/apple-to-outsource-tech-support-to-india/,,,

remapping key combinations ,Mar 13 2006 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,productivity:&:terminal tips , some people may think i am pro-*nix but actually i  really just like getting information out there for all our readers. today i came across a great tip on switch about windows-like key bindings. if you dont dig the way apple has the  start and end key combos mapped  in os x you can change them by creating the file ~/library/keybindings/defaultkeybinding.dict with the following  contents:    /* ~/library/keybindings/defaultkeybinding.dict - home/end keys more like windows */{andquot;uf729andquot; = andquot;movetobeginningofline:andquot;; /* home */ andquot;uf72bandquot; =  andquot;movetoendofline:andquot;; /* end */andquot;$uf729andquot; =  andquot;movetobeginningoflineandmodifyselection:andquot;; /* shift   home */andquot;$uf72bandquot; = andquot;movetoendoflineandmodifyselection:andquot;; /* shift   end */andquot;^uf729andquot; = andquot;movetobeginningofdocument:andquot;; /* control   home */andquot;^uf72bandquot; = andquot;movetoendofdocument:andquot;;/* control   end */}     i personally  tested this key binding hack in 10.4.4 and it does work. to test it be sure to quit out of your text application first.  also note that you will have to create a keybindings/ directory in your ~/library/ because it is not there by default.  to reverse the key bindings back to normal just delete the defaultkeybinding.dict file you created and restart your  text application. if there is a simpler gui way to create these modifications please post about it in the comments for  our readers.if on the other hand you live in  terminal like me the start of line and end of line key bindings are control-a and control-e respectively. this  should feel comfortable to people accustomed to the normal emacs mode in a shell in other *nix based operating  systems.[via switch and  comments on ask slashdot] ,1814,4,4,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/13/remapping-key-combinations/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/13/remapping-key-combinations/,,,
spiffy mac gaming universal binary matrix ,Mar 13 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,gaming:&:universal binary , admittedly the gaming arena for the mac platform isnt nearly as large as that of the pc platform but neither is it  non-existant. and many including myself expect the mac gaming market to grow with apples move to intel chips as it  should make easier the task of porting games from the pc platform. and so its interesting to watch the existing mac  games on the market get translated to universal binaries. macrumors has a spiffy porting chart they are updating as games get  translated.my brief experience with my new 20andquot; intel imac 256mb video card has shown that gaming  performance has improved significantly with every universal binary game ive tried; ut2004 world of warcraft and doom  3 have all scored significantly higher framerates than on my dual 2.0ghz g5 tower 64mb video card. im sure that some  of this is the faster/better video card but i believe its also because the intel chips are just faster. ,922,0,1,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/13/spiffy-mac-gaming-universal-binary-matrix/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/13/spiffy-mac-gaming-universal-binary-matrix/,,,
security flaw found in itunes and quicktime ,Mar 13 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,software:&:security , apple has  announced a security flaw has been found in the latest version of itunes 6.0.1 and 6.0.2 as well as quicktime 7.0.3  and 7.0.4 that affects both mac os x and windows. the flaw could allow an attacker to run code as the currently logged  in user which is typically worse news for windows users but is still not something mac user should take lightly.while apple is working on a patch i thought this sentence from a pc pro article was  somewhat interesting: andquot;[apple] will have around two months to issue a suitable fix before it comes under  pressure as the flaw is only at the initial report stage of the process.andquot; i wonder what exactly that means -  is there some kind of industry consensus that has to be met? or do they just mean that most people who exploit flaws  like this dont use rss readers and wont find out about the flaw for a month or two? hopefully we wont have to find  out.[via macminute] ,930,1,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/13/security-flaw-found-in-itunes-and-quicktime/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/13/security-flaw-found-in-itunes-and-quicktime/,,,

high pitched squeal defect on some macbook pros ,Mar 13 2006 12:00AM,fabienne serriere,hardware:&:macbook pro , while i certainly cant vouch for this problem myself as i dont own a macbook pro there seem to be quite a few  owners of the new laptop with complaints over a high pitched noise emanating from their machines. our own dan pourhadi had a whine on his  new macbook pro even though it may not be the whine being heavily discussed on digg today. dan seems to  have solved his whine by disabling the second core of his  processor described in update 3 on his post.i no longer see this thread digg links to on the apple  forums however i did find another  active thread about the high pitched squeal/noise/whining. some apple users on the digg thread and the apple discussions thread seem to think  this may be repairable in firmware by apple at a later date.i am by no means dissing apple or the digg  crowd with this post but simply would like to remind everyone about early adopter syndrome. the first revision of a  new hardware platform or change in manufacturing is bound to engender certain flaws or bugs. please let us reflect for a moment on the mirrored door g4  and the powerbook 667mhz aka the andquot;666andquot; computer lines.this current flare in comments on digg  and the apple forums doesnt mean that all macbook  pros will be affected by this noise and certainly does not mean that people shouldnt be entitled to a worry-free  machine when purchasing a mac. i hope this all gets cleared up quickly and with some sort of patch or replacement from  apple. we at tuaw are bound to keep you posted.update: please see dan pourhadis new follow-up post  about his macbook pro woes. ,1588,2,2,23, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/13/high-pitched-squeal-defect-on-some-macbook-pros/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/13/high-pitched-squeal-defect-on-some-macbook-pros/,,,

the office upgrade ate two address books, or: why i donand#039;t touch microsoft products ,Mar 19 2006 12:00AM,david chartier,analysis / opinion:&:software , so yknow that office update that came out a few days  ago? the one that spotlight-ified entourage and added syncing abilities with ical and address book? yea um it ate not  only my address book but my fiancandeacute;s which i was subscribed to through .mac.syncing setup is  brainless and painless - theres a new preference section in entourage in which you can individually enable syncing  with ical address book and/or notes through .mac. simple enough. a little while after i checked those options the  .mac syncing engine offered a dialog asking if i would like to merge items between entourage and apples apps or if i  would like to overwrite entourage. i chose to overwrite since i didnt have info in entourages database and i was  simply curious about the app.somehow some way even though i told the engine to overwrite  entourage my address book magically increased to 499 contacts after the first sync operation. maybe it picked up  all those extra friends from myspace or something during the sync because last i checked i only had 326 contacts in  address book. upon investigation some of my contacts had split into separate cards with information either duplicated  or obliterated. even better: i am subscribed to my fiancandeacute;s address book with editing rights through  .mac as were helping to keep each others contacts up to date in preparation for sending out invitations. the  entourage sync not only mangled a seemingly random collection of her contacts but it blew away all of her groups.now before you fire off a snarling comment: yes we have backups. ive turned into quite the backup nazi - but  this post is more of a complaint and a warning about this new entourage feature. who knows if the mishap was the result  of a .mac syncing error or bug but - call me biased if you gotta - i have a sneaking suspicion this had to do with an  office update that wasnt quite finished. ive never had an issue syncing anything else through .mac and that includes  a lot of 3rd party stuff like yojimbo soho notes and transmit favorites.so boys and girls the moral of  the story is a classic: back your stuff up - and often sub-moral: dont trust microsoft even if it is  software from their mac business unit. ,2225,0,1,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/19/the-office-upgrade-ate-two-address-books-or-why-i-dont-touch/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/19/the-office-upgrade-ate-two-address-books-or-why-i-dont-touch/,,

the ipod as demand for action ,Mar 19 2006 12:00AM,dave caolo,accessories:&:analysis / opinion:&:ipod family , believe  it or not not everyone loves the ipod. while i dont count myself among the  haters i do see how this is sort of obnoxious.  tiny stickers that when affixed to your ipod shuffle announce either your desire to engage in conversation or your  wish to be left completely alone. hey im glad that youre enjoying your ipod but i dont need to have the thing  telling me what to do.now i understand i think the idea here. typically the act of wearing headphones  in public sends a clear andquot;leave me aloneandquot; signal. the andquot;talk to meandquot; sticker would come into play if a  person was open to chat despite the fact that s/he was wearing headphones in fact the stickers were born as a result  of marco siebertzs senior thesis exploring the  social implications of using headphones specifically as a sign for non-communication. an interesting idea but i  still think that the same result could be achieved through other means like eye contact a smile or heaven forbid  actually turing your darn ipod off for a minute or two.[via the blog herald] ,1063,3,1,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/19/the-ipod-as-obnoxious-demand-for-action/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/19/the-ipod-as-obnoxious-demand-for-action/,,,

half life 2 on a mac ,Mar 20 2006 12:00AM,damien barrett,gaming:&:macbook pro , so we  all know that last week the solution was released to allow intel macs to dual-boot between mac os x and windows xp.  and a lot of people even a few of our readers...gasp! have been rending their clothes twisting their undergarments  and gnashing their teeth at the thought of a mac running winxp. oh why oh why must people besmirch the glorious mac  and sully its gleaming perfection with an os as vulgar and nefarious as windows xp? oh the travesty the  inhumanity!yeah blah blah blah...whatever. its about games plain and simple. and i knew that the first  thing people would do once they got their intel macs to boot windows would be to install games. witness this video of  half life 2 running in windows on a macbook pro.  not all is  perfect however. there is no fan control on the macbook pro running windows xp and so you risk cooking your macbook pro if you run winxp for too  long. update: [okay so the jurys still out on this one;  some people are reporting significant fan and heat problems and others are not. as always know that installing winxp  on your intel mac may violate your warranty and that if you fry your mac because there isnt actually any fan control  its not apples fault or even microsofts fault. it should go without saying of course:andnbsp; be careful. know what  youre doing.]in my own winxp on mac experiments ive as yet been unable to get winxp pro to install on my  20andquot; intel imac. even with the newest xom.efi file the winxp install hangs at 0% and wont continue. so im playing the waiting game  until the people writing the xom.efi boot loaders figure out the problem and release a new one. ,1644,0,14,24, http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/20/half-life-2-on-a-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2006/03/20/half-life-2-on-a-mac/,,,
