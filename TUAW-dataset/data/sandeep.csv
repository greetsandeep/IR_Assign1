itand#8217;s all happneing ,Apr 5 2004 12:00AM,caryn coleman,  , art and education go hand-in-hand. while i worked in the education department at the    museum of contemporary art in chicago i realized that art is education and    contextualizing it for the general public is necessary. part of my job there was to assist in producing audio tours.    these audio tours were contained in wand-like devices that housed audio files of either the curators or exhibiting    artists discussing selected artwork in an exhibition. visitors purchased these audio tours for an additional fee at    the admissions desks and were off to experience a one-person tour at their own pace. a non-perfected system these    types of tours are generally laughed at by the art community but none-the-less have the potentional to be a bridge    the gap between gaining valuable insite and walking away confused.                soon after i left the mca abandoned these tours as the production and equipment cost is quite high and given the    current financial strain on todayand#8217;s art centers they were the first to go in an effort to conserve money. but boy    are things a-changing. now museums not only have the chance to improve on the nature of these tours but can now do it    for a reasonable price. forward-thinking museums in    japan and    france via    macnn have adopted ipods to house mp3s of art folk discussing    exhibitions. since the ipod is inexpensive holds an insane amount of files is painfully simple to use and can    allow museums to easily rotate sound bytes about specific art pieces itand#8217;s almost crazy to think that more museums    are not doing this! united states iand#8217;m talking to you. ,1650,4,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/its-all-happneing/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/its-all-happneing/,,
is apple itand#8217;s own worst enemy? ,Apr 5 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , fellow win blogger pariah made this statement the other day:        actually appleand#8217;s current direction is the biggest proponent for using windows. apple is doing its best to force  everyone to windows by strangling the market for third-party applications developers on the mac.    needless to say some people had some questions about what he was implying and where he was headed saying something  like that so heand#8217;s been kind enough to explain himself in a little more detail. thius editorial makes the arguement that  apple relies strongly on 3rd party software for a number of reasons and if it keeps trying to beat those companies at  their own game itand#8217;s going to lose in the long run. iand#8217;m not certain i agree with this. i think competition is good and  if people only have one option they are stuck with something with no choice. when thereand#8217;s several programs all doing  the same thing people will lean towards who ever is doing that better. if apple can do it better either those other  companies need to step up to the plate or people will start using the apple version. likewise if they are doing such  a great job in the first place they shouldnand#8217;t be worried about someone doing it better.        iand#8217;m all for improvements whichever side them come from. for example people moved away from outlook because  mail.app is a better program but the first e-mail application that stops spam 100% will be the king regardless of  what company makes it or if it plays nicely with ichat. ,1540,0,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/is-apple-its-own-worst-enemy/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/is-apple-its-own-worst-enemy/,,
playfair strips drm from itunes ,Apr 5 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , iand#8217;m going to let this one speek for itself:        when apple opened the itunes  music store they licensed a technology called and#8220;fairplayand#8221; from a company called and#8220;veridiscand#8221;. fairplay is a digital  rights management drm system that limits a users rights on a digital media file that theyand#8217;ve purchased and presumably  downloaded. in the case of appleand#8217;s itunes music store when a user downloads an audio track from itms it is a  and#8220;protected aac audio fileand#8221;. when used as intended these files can only be played through the itunes program itself.  furthermore a particular computer must first be and#8220;authorizedand#8221; to play the given file. fairplay allows up to three  computers and unlimited apple ipods to be authorized to play the file. as drm schemes go fairplay is only moderately  offensive.    so what will playfair do for you? the playfair program is quite simple. it takes one of the itms protected aac  audio files decodes it using a key obtained from your ipod or microsoft windows system and then writes the new  decoded version to disk as a regular aac audio file. it then optionally copies the metadata tags that describe the  song including the cover art to the new file.    i just got my first taste of itunes drm the other day when i coppied some songs i bought from one of my laptops to  my desktop imac and then onto my other laptop and started getting some static. iand#8217;m planning of retiring my 15and#8221; g4  tibook sometime this year and i know that the new machine i get is only going to complicate this more. macnn points out  that this app requires xcode and runs from the terminal. ,1690,0,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/playfair-strips-drm-from-itunes/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/05/playfair-strips-drm-from-itunes/,,

trojan horse virus exploits weakness in mac os x ,Apr 8 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , though the mac platform is relatively free from the harassment of viral infections that regularly hamper wintel  users its not completely immune from the handiwork of those looking to cause mischief or harm. case in point:  intego developer of virusbarrier has put out a  security alert of the mp3concept mp3virus.gen trojan horse a  deceptive piece of code that couldandnbsp; easily be launched by mistake due to itand#8217;s fallacious cover. the code is hidden  away in the id3 tag of a seemingly benign mp3 file but stores hidden code that could possibly and#8220;damage or delete  files onandnbsp; computers running mac os xand#8220;.        andnbsp;this trojan horse has the potential to do any of the following:       andnbsp;- delete all of a userand#8217;s personal files       andnbsp;- send an e-mail message containing a copy of itself to other users       andnbsp;- infect other mp3 jpeg gif or quicktime files             due to the use of this technique users can no longer safely double-clickandnbsp; mp3 files in mac os x. this same  technique could be used with jpeg andandnbsp; gif files though no such cases of infected graphic files have yet been  seen.    not likely as dire as intego would like you to believe considering they specialize in viral protection software.  but definitely worth considering and being aware of. unlike condoms you donand#8217;t want trojan variety software for  protection. ,1425,2,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/08/trojan-horse-virus-exploits-weakness-in-mac-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/08/trojan-horse-virus-exploits-weakness-in-mac-os-x/,,

close windows save power,Apr 8 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , mac os x hints just tipped us off to a great way to save cpu power:            have you ever noticed that if you are downloading many things in safari and have the and#8220;downloadsand#8221; window open your  cpu usage jumps up? on my 800mhz g4 this can amount to 40%. if i close the downloads window or hide safari this usage  drops back down to 5%.    this got me thinking and it turns out that its the repeated updates to the window that crunches the cpu not the  downloads. by hiding apps you can reduce the number of cpu cycles they use as osx no longer has to re-draw their  windows when something changes. programs which show progress bars or other such frequent window changes are most  affected. ,707,0,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/08/close-windows-save-power/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/08/close-windows-save-power/,,

playfair is history ,Apr 9 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , earlier this week i was talking about playfair  the app that strips drm from itunes. well according to  macslash itand#8217;s been shut down.            and#8221;apple computer issued a cease and desist order to sourceforge to shut down the playfair web site cache. the  development team is currently looking for a new home for the project. itand#8217;s not surprising that apple did this but i  guess iand#8217;m still disappointed whenever they whack someone with a lawyer.and#8221; no proof that it was an apple candamp;d. you can  still find playfair in a sourceforge search but it returns a page saying and#8220;invalid project.and#8221; ,644,2,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/09/playfair-is-history/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/09/playfair-is-history/,,
trojan horse follow up ,Apr 9 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , the news of this trojan horse has been spreading  everywhere however miro a  boingboing reader has posted some  interesting follow up:               the mac os x mp3 trojan is being blown completely out of proportion. quick review of facts so far:    1. it was pointed out in a usenet thread that it is possible to embed arbitrary data in an mp3 2. it was  subsequently suggested that the arbitrary data could be executable 3. an enterprising developer proceeded to then  create a file which to any mp3 player will appear as an mp3 file but the mac os x finder sees it as an application 4.  an anti-virus vendor published advertising for their product saying that it has a cure for this form of trojan.    some other relevant points:    1. this has little to do with mac os x vs. mac os 9. the exact same file will do the exact same thing on mac os 9 and#8212;  be playable by mp3 players and act as an application 2. this has little to do with mac os x using extensions to  identify file types. the icon shown by the finder could be embedded in the file itself in which case the file would  look like an mp3 file regardless of its name. 3. this trick requires using the resource fork and therefore the file  has to be transmitted encoded. any mp3 file that is transferred as a plain binary file as opposed to a mac binary  file with the resource fork is harmless. 4. the fact that the file can be played in am mp3 player is irrelevant; if  the trojan were malicious the user would be doomed after double-clicking on it regardless of whether the file is a  valid audio file.    to summarize a mac application can have any icon or name whatsoever including a name and an icon that make it  look like a document. exactly what happens when you receive such an application in email or by downloading it in your  browser depends on your settings but i am not aware of any case in which it will be automatically launched.    therefore to activate this trojan you have to either receive a mac-encoded attachment and double-click on it in  the finder or you have to download a mac-encoded a file which is then usually decoded to your desktop and  double-click it in the finder.    the only reason that this is news is that a vendor of anti-virus software took it as an opportunity to generate  some advertising as far as i can tell. ,2326,3,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/09/trojan-horse-follow-up/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/09/trojan-horse-follow-up/,,
ipod rss ,Apr 10 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , you can get your rss feeds on just about anything now even your ipod. a program called ipod agent is supposed to do  that and a bunch of other things except itand#8217;s windows based so i and probably a lot of other mac people wonand#8217;t be able  to check it out. in addition to that daily wireless has a round of of readers for just about any mobile device you can  think of - pda smartphones spot watches etc. they talk about how this is strictly for early adopters now but  perhaps not for long.               in conclusion rss might be pretty good for mobile devices in fact i think itand#8217;ll be so popular its likely people  wonand#8217;t notice or care what it is or where it came from. it will be a pervasive part of our mobile device experience;  youand#8217;ll get news articles and posts from the blogs you like to read all on your mobile device displayed in a great  way. for now itand#8217;s a bit geeky not what anyone would call mainstream so perhaps this is just a crystal ball view but  itand#8217;s not a bad one.    thanks seven ,1056,1,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/10/ipod-rss/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/10/ipod-rss/,,
carbon fiber g5 powerbooks? ,Apr 12 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , this post from mac os rumors might be some of the coolest news  iand#8217;ve heard all week.            weand#8217;ve been hearing reports very similar to what has been making the rounds on the mac web like wildfire and#8212;  speculation about a powerbook g5 enclosure constructed from carbon fiber.    one specific type of carbon fiber mentioned by our sources is high-resin thermoplastic.    this material lends itself to sub-milimeter moulding precision at relatively reasonable costs and would allow for  surprisingly sleek lines while retaining the kind of thin enclosures weand#8217;ve seen since the introduction of the powerbook  g4. it could also allow for many passive cooling vents without sacrificing attractive looks.    anyone who has ever seen bare unpainted carbon fiber knows the beauty of its black-on-black weave and can imagine  many ways in which it could be made to bring back the days of the and#8220;armani suitand#8221; black powerbook with post-modern  style. ,988,1,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/carbon-fiber-g5-powerbooks/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/carbon-fiber-g5-powerbooks/,,

delay cream on the g5 update dream ,Apr 12 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , apple insider has yet another  detailed report regarding power mac g5 update delays:        according to a reliable source apple was recently forced to completely rework the internal temperature sensors  inside the current g5 case design to accommodate the new 90 nanometer g5 processors. apparently the new 90nm daughter  cards have a different profile and seat position than the cards included in the initial power mac g5.           andnbsp;and#8221;the sensors were reading an incorrect temperature coming off of the heat-sinks and this would throw the fans  into a frenzyand#8221; one source said. and#8220;the fans would spin up to an intolerably noisy speed and then the machine would shut  itself down to prevent damaging the processors even though the internal temperature of the processors remained well  below 27-degrees celsius.and#8221;    low yields of ibmand#8217;s power pc 970fx chips at 2.0ghz+ speeds is also reported as a cause for the delay. i hope this is  not a redux of the problems apple had with motorola processor updates for those depressing lean sub 1ghz  years. ,1092,1,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/delay-cream-on-the-g5-update-dream/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/delay-cream-on-the-g5-update-dream/,,

ipod car mod ,Apr 12 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , iand#8217;ve got one of those casette adapters that i plug into my ipod for use in the car. it does pretty much what i need  it to do. a friend of mine went an extra step and had a wire installed into his stereo so he can skip the whole casette  translation part. thatand#8217;s enough for most people but for people like jesse melchior nothing short of a custom base is  going to do the trick.            i used the center console of my  car to sculpt an add-on piece that would house the ipod mini and connect it to my existing car stereo. i took a mold of  the final sculpture using l-200 latex and backed it with an ultracal 30 plaster shell to hold its shape. i then cast  the piece using dental acrylic. using the belkin car charger i connected it to the ipod mini and placed the ipod into  the acrylic piece at the angle i wanted then flipped the whole piece over and poured another layer of dental acrylic  over the protruding edge of the ipod mini and the car charger creating a perfectly snug fit for the ipod to rest into  and connect to the charger. ,1063,0,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/ipod-car-mod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/12/ipod-car-mod/,,

get back those missing mp3 ,Apr 14 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , when i used to work in the music industry i was always getting cdrs from bands of songs they were working on from a  live show or had just recorded in their own studios. in most cases the cdrs i would get would be one of maybe 3-4 in  existance and iand#8217;d have to send them on to someone else right away. in the old days people made casetre copies but this  was 1995 so iand#8217;d always make mp3s of these songs right away.            needless to say these songs were not in the cddb or available to be downloaded anywhere. one of my biggest complaints  with early versions of many mp3 players including itunes was that they would try to organize my music collection and  every time it did this iand#8217;d lose a bunch of these songs. theyand#8217;d just be gone. full drive searches and everything to no  avail. the only thing we could figure out was that since they had been made with all kinds of different software  mpecker etc.. itunes thought they were bad files and just deleted them. i still havenand#8217;t been able to replace a lot  of those songs.            subrosasoft just released  mp3restore which seems like it would  have been a lifesaver for me back then. this app is supposed to be able to find and recover mp3s that were accidentally  deleted or have gone missing from portable players or your own hard drive. oh subrosasoft where where you when i  needed you? ,1392,1,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/14/get-back-those-missing-mp3/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/14/get-back-those-missing-mp3/,,

ipod going down with the mac ship? ,Apr 15 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , despite all the evidence to the contrary weand#8217;re still reading that mac is minutes from going out of business. this  weeks death wish comes from cnet who speculates  that apple not jumping all over real networks offer is suicide and will end up dragging the ipod down with it. ew..  scary.            now realnetworks ceo rob  glaser and some others see the potential for history to repeat itself in the digital music world if apple persists in  keeping its software and hardware closed. apple has taken some major steps to avoid past mistakes notably making the  ipod compatible with windows pcs dramatically expanding its potential market. ipod sales last quarter helped apple  triple its earnings compared with the same period a year ago.    but thatand#8217;s a half measure according to glaser who recently quipped that apple might go the way of the soviet  union unless it takes a more liberal stance toward licensing its software specifically the fairplay digital rights  management drm controls that prevent songs purchased through itunes from being illegally copied.    and#8221;appleand#8217;s market share will go down if they continue to do thisand#8221; glaser said at last monthand#8217;s pc forum. he  predicted that customers will say and#8220;i bought an ipod and can only shop at one store. what is this? the soviet  union?and#8221; ,1358,1,0,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/ipod-going-down-with-the-mac-ship/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/ipod-going-down-with-the-mac-ship/,,
an isore? ,Apr 15 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , john king of the san francisco  chronicle makes a critical observation of appleand#8217;s san francisco flagship storeand#8217;s architectural presence today:        here we are at a prime corner on one of the busiest streets in one of the nationand#8217;s last vibrant retail districts  and the top two-thirds of the store is blank closed off. pedestrians walk below sheets of cold thin steel each wall  bare but for a backlit company logo.    considering appleand#8217;s historical dedication to the virtue of design iand#8217;d agree there is some validity in noting the  almost machine-made aesthetic architecture of appleand#8217;s retail locations in a city that prides itself in fighting  cookie-cutter urban development. but the sf writer seems to pine for the aesthetic of an apple of years gone by:        apple prides itself on curvaceous computers. its ipod minis come in five colors. iand#8217;d love to see the same design  flexibility where it would matter most and#8212; the world we all share.    curvaceous computers? seems like a case of g3 nostalgia in a g5 world since apple hasnand#8217;t released a curve-inspired  piece of hardware in quite awhile.        but my personal experience inside many of the california location stores has been nothing but sheer joy well  besides the pushy crowds that gathered around the g5s when first released and i appreciate the decision to move away  from the playfulness of the original imacs in both identity and industrial design. the interior architecture strikes me  as being both representitive of the post-fruitalicious-imac apple identity with the newest ipod minis even subtley  shaded in metallic colours and a retail experience that aims for inviting technological luxury. but maybe mr. king  has a point. apple could set aside their flagship stores with unique and challenging architecture interior and  exterior that would mirror their dedication to and#8220;think differentand#8221;. maybe future stores will come in silver gold  green pink or blue. ,2022,0,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/an-isore/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/15/an-isore/,,

ernie the attorney: the joys of apple computers ,Apr 16 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , last night i was thinking it might be cool to talk to some well known bloggers who use macs and ask them why. this  morning i wake up and see that  ernie the attorney has  beaten me to the punch and publically declaired his love of the mac. he wrote a pretty good rant on the subject but  this is the part i echo to all my pc using friends and family when they start compaining about some mis-configured /  crashing problem.            call me crazy but i think that computers should be so  easy to use that the word and#8216;configurationand#8217; becomes obsolete as a computer term. there are so many things about apple  computers that make life easier e.g. they rarely crash rarely need rebooting and simply donand#8217;t need to have the os  reinstalled every year as part of and#8216;routine maintenanceand#8217;. macs are more secure and not just because people donand#8217;t write  viruses for them. i could go on with all of the things iand#8217;ve learned about macs in the past year. but iand#8217;m really wasting  my time here because if you have a mac and run os x then you already know what iand#8217;m talking about. and if you only use  pcs then you are going to have to defend your choice which for many many people isnand#8217;t a real choice because they just  bought what the herd was buying; at least thatand#8217;s what i did up until a year ago.    but no one can dispute this statement: computers should be easy to use and they should as much as possible  configure themselves. having used macs and pcs extensively over the past 10 years i can tell you itand#8217;s not even a close  contest. apple computers are easier to use and configure.    bingo. most of the people i know who use pcs use them because thatand#8217;s what they always used and all their reasons  for not using a mac come from what they heard someone else say since they never actually used one themselves. in fact  iand#8217;d say 9 out of 10 of those people who in the last 4-5 years were given the opportunity to use a mac switched. my  mother-in-law uses a computer for e-mail web surfing and printing pictures from her digital camera yet scoffs at the  idea of using an apple. she doesnand#8217;t know much easier her life would be. ,2234,1,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/16/ernie-the-attorney-the-joys-of-apple-computers/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/16/ernie-the-attorney-the-joys-of-apple-computers/,,

partying like its 1999 ,Apr 30 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , diverging from rumor mill tidbits software updates or news of an ipod conversion into a portable colonic irrigator  here is a trivial yet personal apple related story from yours truly:        as a freelance graphic designer for the last few years i normally work at home on my own machine a 933mhz g4 w/1gb  ram which i am completely and comfortably acquainted with. the apple keyboard and mouse yes a designer who is still  using a 1-button mouseandhellip;the horror! feel like an extension of my own limbs and the hard drives are organized much like  my underwear drawer: clean stuff out on the desktop all the dirty files hidden away. its by no means the fastest  machine and i often daydream of working on dual g5and#8217;s of any integer. but for now i work happily quickly and  efficiently on my slightly greying-at-the-temples g4. unfortunately my current freelance project is an in-house  contract job which involves a notable downgrade: i now work on a 300mhz blue andamp; white g3 supported with only 256mb  of memory and 1gb hard drive [cue in dramatic music]! this is like one night going to sleep with jessica alba and then  waking up the next morning next to liza minelli. with os x panther running quarkxpress 6 illustrator cs and photoshop  cs all at once this looked to be a production nightmare. the newest software on antiquated hardware. i was steering a  ferrari modena being pulled by a 3-legged mule named gimpy on a bumpy road.             amazingly this seemingly underpowered setup has been useable and responsive overall thanks to appleand#8217;s efficient os.  yes its noticeably slow rendering/updating images and i pine for my own beloved apple 23and#8221; display while working with  two page spreads on a and#8220;smallerand#8221; 20and#8221; crt. but overall its amazing how well os x panther and the elderly g3 processor  handles everything thrown at it with the minimal amount of memory and megahertz rating now regularly seen in some  handheld devices. even with multiple page document layouts opened in quarkxpress several illustrator files underneath  alongside a tiff file or two in photoshop the machine was operating at satisfactory performance. the spinning beach  ball only appeared while printing pdfs directly from quark which is a godsend compared to the days of creating  postscript files and distilling them afterwardandhellip;i could have hand coded os xi during some of those os 9 powered days  and iand#8217;ve been impressed with the computerand#8217;s steady refusal to buckle under the duress under the sort of computational  workload that i would have guessed would be too much for the machine. all with a piddly 256mb of ram! iand#8217;m proud of this  samwise gamgee of computing. if this was an os 9 setup the combination of the graphic workload multiple opened memory  hungry applications the slow processor and minimal amount of memory would probably result in regular three-button  salute resets. that all being said iand#8217;m working hard on convincing the company about letting me work remotely from home  on a machine from this decade. i admire the effort but the performance still leaves my impatient behind wanting.  still its an impressive feat illustrating the adage of non-rotting apples and their computational constitution. ,3298,0,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/30/partying-like-its-1999/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/04/30/partying-like-its-1999/,,

massive os x security issue ,May 18 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , jay allen and  liz lawley are talking about  a serious security hole in os x.               two vulnerabilities have been reported in mac os x allowing malicious web sites to compromise a vulnerable  system.    1 the problem is that the and#8220;helpand#8221; uri handler allows execution of arbitrary local scripts .scpt via the classic  directory traversal character sequence using and#8220;help:runscriptand#8221;.    2 it is reportedly also possible to silently place arbitrary files in a known location including script files on  a userand#8217;s system using the and#8220;diskand#8221; uri handler.    various variants of the uri handler vulnerabilities are currently being discussed. this has been confirmed on  macintosh os x using safari 1.2.1 v125.1 and internet explorer 5.2. other browsers may also be used as attack  vectors.    note: the rating has been upgraded to and#8220;extremely criticaland#8221; because the issues are very easy to exploit and a large  number of working exploits are available.    thereand#8217;s even more details on  macnn but  if you just want to fix it liz suggests:               if like me you just want to know how to fix this fast since apple has apparently known about this since february  and hasnand#8217;t fixed it it wouldnand#8217;t be wise to wait for their patch hereand#8217;s the approach to use.    andnbsp;andnbsp;andnbsp; 1. download the freeware tool  moreinternet.    andnbsp;andnbsp;andnbsp; 2. from the disk image run and#8220;install prefpaneand#8221; which will put the moreinternet preference panel  into your system preferences panel.    andnbsp;andnbsp;andnbsp; 3. open the moreinternet panel and select the help: protocol.    andnbsp;andnbsp;andnbsp; 4. change the application it launches from the help viewer which has the script-running  vulnerability to something benign. i used textedit. i used chess which unlike textedit gives me a clear visual  cue that a page tried to invoke the help: protocol.    andnbsp;andnbsp;andnbsp; 5. make sure it worked by going to the scary  but harmless example.update    : macnn is reporting that apple is taking this very seriouslyand#8221; and is  and#8220;actively investigating this potential security issue.and#8221; ,2230,7,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/05/18/massive-os-x-security-issue/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/05/18/massive-os-x-security-issue/,,

what to do with an old imac ,May 22 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , i know a lot of people with one of those old and#8220;flavoredand#8221; imacs sitting around. i even have one myself. but what to do  with it? not so long ago the hd on it died and i got a bigger one and more ram installed which brought the whole  machine back to life. bob levitus gives the same advice in the  houston chronicle:            in the end i recommended keeping the imac but  adding a bigger hard drive and more ram. i speculated that upgrading to mac os x 10.3 panther might offer additional  speed but wasnand#8217;t as important as the ram and disk.    it worked. after backing up their 10-gb drive i installed a 512-mb ram chip $139 and a 120-gb hard disk $100  and iand#8217;ll be darned if the thing didnand#8217;t run a whole lot faster.    the ram upgrade required no tools and took less than five minutes. installing an internal hard drive isnand#8217;t quite so  simple and will void your warranty so while an external firewire hard disk will cost a bit more itand#8217;s a better  solution. for those of you who insist on doing it yourself upgrading the internal hard drive took a screwdriver and  about 30 minutes working from instructions i found on the internet.    my point today is that adding ram or an external hard disk to most macs is a piece of cake. for less than $250 my  friends now have a smooth-running imac that will serve them for many years to come. ,1393,1,0,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/05/22/what-to-do-with-an-old-imac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/05/22/what-to-do-with-an-old-imac/,,

more g5 rumors ,Jun 4 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , apple insider has turned up the heat amongst the mac rumors community with their successive days of details that  might possibly foreshadow new g5and#8217;s coming very very soon. first  new photos in an apple service and repair document which  appears to show the updated and unreleased power mac g5. according to this document the new machines will sport larger  heatsink covers smaller motherboards and the omission of front inlet fans that are contained in current g5 cases. and  then today apple insider notes thatandnbsp; and#8220;apple  computer inc. has told several resellers not to expect any further shipments of its imac g4 and has delayed new power  mac g5 orders from some resellers by several weeksand#8220; a sign that apple is emptying stock to make room for the  arrival of both new g5 power macs and new imac models.             insanely great mac is reporting a similar analysis with  realistic and conservative estimates of the predicted new lineup:        the word around the traps is that the base model might be 2ghz single processor with a 2.5 or 2.6ghz dp in there  somewhere. dp 3ghz is for the more optimistic tipsters. given that the availability of high-end processors is likely to  be constrained one wonders whether apple would go with dps - at least to begin with.    the timeframe for steve jobs to fulfill his promise of 3 ghz machines 12-months later after the announcement last  june is closing in quickly. 2.6 ghz is not the same as 3.0 but its sure heck of better than staying stagnant at dual  2.0. ,1540,3,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/06/04/more-g5-rumors/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/06/04/more-g5-rumors/,,

former microsoftie loves apple ,Jun 8 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , iand#8217;ve been out for a few days so maybe everyone has already seen  this article by jeff reifman about  what he sees as the coming end of microsoft funny thing is much of his revelation was spured by switching to  apple:            i began using microsoft products 23 years ago at age 11 and i worked for microsoft from 1991 to 1999 as a  technology manager. for many years i was a microsoft loyalist. while aware of microsoftand#8217;s shortcomings i always  believed that the soft did its best to improve products over time as it did with windows xp. but recently iand#8217;ve had a  crisis of faith. perhaps iand#8217;ve rebooted windows one too many times.    over the past year my frustration with windows grew as did my envy of appleand#8217;s cool new products. finally last  month i went out and bought an apple macintosh g5 and began using the new mac operating system os x. it had been years  since iand#8217;d used a macintosh. until recently i dismissed those who did as impractical elitist hipsters and i mocked  the mac and#8220;switchand#8221; ads on tv.    but in the first five minutes on my new mac i was surfing the internet sending e-mail and ripping a cd. os x has  been a breath of badly needed fresh air after windows.    this made me wonder about microsoftand#8217;s willingness to innovate and compete. why are microsoft products still so  difficult to use and so unreliable? why is the company improving them so slowly? is microsoft losing its competitive  edge? has the company seen its best days? ,1531,1,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/06/08/former-microsoftie-loves-apple/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/06/08/former-microsoftie-loves-apple/,,

my iloan hell ,Jun 8 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , last week my old powerbook died. iand#8217;m pretty sure the update to os x 10.3.4 did it in. lots of people are complaining  about the same kind of symptoms i was having but compounded with a laptop iand#8217;d been using as a primary machine all day  every day for the last three years it was just too much. by tuesday it was crashing 5 minutes after booting up and  taking 10 power button restarts to even get that far so i decided it was time for a new one. by thursday iand#8217;d decided  that a maxed out 15and#8221; was the one i needed. unfortunately it wasnand#8217;t that easy.            i didnand#8217;t have an extra $3k laying around so my options were either put it on a credit card iand#8217;d just finished paying  off or buy it through my business and try for a small business loan from apple. at this point my old laptop wouldnand#8217;t  even start so i needed a new one now. i called apple and explained my situation and was told the fastest thing to do  would be to go to a store and talk with someone there about the best option.            on thursday around 4pm i called the glendale apple store to see if there would be someone there i could talk to about  business financing if i came by that evening. i was told there would be and that was that. i showed up around 7pm and  the conversation with the guy at the counter went pretty much like this:            me: hi can i talk to someone about business financing for a powerbook?      apple store guy: heand#8217;s not here.      me: oh? i called this afternoon and they said someone would be here this evening.      asg: yeah he left.      me: ...      asg: ...      me: ok well i need to talk to him. will he be here at this time tomorrow?      asg: yeah.      me: are you sure?      asg: yeah.      me: what time will he be here tomorrow?      asg: from like noon to 5pm.      me: you realize itand#8217;s 7pm now and you just told me heand#8217;d be here at this time tomorrow right?      asg: ...      me: is there someone at another store i can talk to tonight?      asg: maybe.      me: can you check?            so that guy runs off and some other dude calls the apple store at the grove and they say there is someone and will be  all night. by the time i get to the car i decide driving across town isnand#8217;t worth it and will just deal with it the next  day.            friday around 1pm i got to the grove and found someone to help me right away. i spent about an hour discussion options  and filling out paperwork. i explain the situation to him and that i need a computer as soon as i can get one because  my other one is dead and i canand#8217;t get online or do work or anything. he tells me the process usually takes about 2 hours  and heand#8217;ll give me a call the second he hears back so i can swing back by and pick up a new machine. just to make sure i  jot down my cell phone number on the application as well as the office one iand#8217;d already provided. all sounds good and i  take off to get some food.            by 7pm i still hadnand#8217;t heard back so i call the store to check in. the guy i spoke to tells me that thereand#8217;s no one there  who can help and i should just try back the next day. fine ok whatever.            saturday noon. i call and this time iand#8217;m told that:      1. they have no idea what iand#8217;m talking about.      2. without an account number they canand#8217;t look anything up.      3. the only way iand#8217;d have an account number was if iand#8217;d heard back from someone there.      4. i was welcomed to leave a message and the store manager would call me back when she was next in which should be end  of the following week.            needless to say i wasnand#8217;t excited about this.            i decided to wait until monday and if there was still no word iand#8217;d just have to buy it with the credit card. so monday  rolls around and rather than play phone games i just go in. i know i have to go there to buy one regardless so that  seemed like the best bet. i got there around 2pm and went to talk to the guy at the count,6269,0,0,13, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/06/08/my-iloan-hell/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/06/08/my-iloan-hell/,,

mike davidson makes the case for the apple iphone ,Jul 26 2004 12:00AM,sean bonner,  , mike davidson is a great blogger who regularly writes well thought out essays. yesterday he made the  case for the apple iphone. itand#8217;s been on wishlists  for years but mike thinks thereand#8217;s a real chance for it to materialize.               the ipod and the treo are about the same size they both play mp3s and yet the ipod only does a few things better.  it has up to 40 gigs of storage as compared to the 1 gig sd card you can stick in a treo. thatand#8217;s about 10000 songs  vs. 250 songs albeit in removable form. the second thing is does better is provide a dedicated music-centric  interface. the treoand#8217;s interface must do 1000 things with the ipodand#8217;s does only do a few. and finally the ipod looks a  little better than the treo and that is a testiment to appleand#8217;s legendary design prowess.    aside from those three things however the treo dropkicks the ipod right off the playing field. it makes calls  organizes contacts syncs with pcs and macs plays games runs applications gets email surfs the web checks blogs  has crazy-high battery life and on and on and on. so if i only have room for one cigarette-pack-sized device in my  pants pocket which one am i going to pick? thatand#8217;s easy. there is no good reason for portable music players to continue  on as standalone units and apple being a smart company realizes this. ,1375,1,0,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/07/26/mike-davidson-makes-the-case-for-the-apple-iphone/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/07/26/mike-davidson-makes-the-case-for-the-apple-iphone/,,

get emote-ional ,Aug 4 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , i personally use proteus for my everyday  instant messaging but its always fun to test drive other new chat client that might offer just a little bit more or  something wildly new. emotemail diverges from the usual laundry list of  features of other instant messengers and adds an additional dimension to online communication by  capturing facial expressions and indicators of typing speed  with graphical cues. an interesting direction that might not catch on because in a sense people seem to enjoy the  anonymity of online chat. might be interesting to cyber with ;        instead of dynamically modifying individual characters emotemail relates contextual cues to each paragraph. the  prototype uses a camera and a timer as sensor inputs to capture additional information relating to the paragraph.  reminiscent of the commonly used smileys the emotemail client annotates every paragraph with a small black and white  thresholded image of the face of the writer. each paragraph also includes a background colour representing how much  time the paragraph took to compose. if the sender changes their facial expression perhaps as part of an emotionally  meaningful communication then the small camera grab beside each paragraph reflects this. by capturing a snapshot of  the face of the writer with every paragraph the system attempts to display the fluctuation of the emotions throughout  the message rather than attempting to summarize the whole message as a certain mood. ,1478,2,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/08/04/get-emote-ional/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/08/04/get-emote-ional/,,

izartan ,Aug 16 2004 12:00AM,gregory han,  , the mac observer  notes that apple has applied for a  patent for a colour changing computer case using and#8220;a collection of red green and blue leds capable of being used to  generate any colour entered as an rgb valueand#8221;. looks like the concept is aimed at the imac and/or emac line of  products:        a computing device is disclosed. the computing device includes a housing having an illuminable portion. the  computing device also includes a light device disposed inside the housing. the light device is configured to illuminate  the illuminable portion.    personally the concept in itself sounds too gimmicky/cheezy for apple to seriously pursue simply as an aesthetic  direction. the idea was actually penned back in 1999 but apple filed for a trademark on a and#8220;morph padand#8221; in the uk on  july 14 2004 possibly indicating more solid plans regarding the use of such a concept in the finicky and trend hungry  consumer market. but iand#8217;m sure apple has plans of creatively incorporating the feature into something greater than a  computational disco ball. or not. the obvious idea would connect such a feature with music/multimedia. another idea  would use the case colour capability to indicate the status of your computer in much the same way the power light  pulses on various apple computers when in sleep mode i.e. after an application crash the case would flash red several  times or when a file was sucessfully downloaded the case would change green to notify. ,1501,1,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/08/16/izartan/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/08/16/izartan/,,

apple phone? ,Sep 17 2004 12:00AM,greg scher,  , businessweek on an opportunity squandered by steve jobs:       andnbsp;i donand#8217;t mean apple should lay a bunch of fiber-optic cable and fill large buildings with high-price    switching equipment. rather jobs andamp; co. could provide the graphical interface and the ease of use. for the guts    of the network apple could easily contract with other companies or try a bring-your-own bandwidth peer-to-peer    approach like skype. the potential downside is minimal. the possible upside is significant. hereand#8217;s why:                everyone knows the business models that powered old-style phone networks are rapidly unraveling. the baby bells have    seen a steady decline of the number of phone lines connected to their networks. consumers are increasingly cutting    the cord and using a cell phone as their primary mode of communication.      hereand#8217;s why i disagree.andnbsp; apple looked around at the other players in the space and recognized that given all    the hype around voip and similair services and the forthcoming attention by the fcc the last thing they wanted to    do was jump into the middle of that fray at this stage.andnbsp;          to much is still uncertain about the voip business model and its ability to compete with copper given similair tax    laws. the current consumer draw to voip outside the homes of geeks like me is that itand#8217;s cheap.andnbsp; if the fcc    decides to tax voip more or less like copper well that levels the playing field to a large degree.andnbsp; so if    skype is a voip provider and their service skypeout does move them closer to that space then they to are subject    to the same taxes as verizon and all the others makingandnbsp;it a not so profitable business anymore since the basic    services provided by skype are free. ,1808,0,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/09/17/apple-phone/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/09/17/apple-phone/,,

zen and the art of wi-fi nirvanna ,Sep 22 2004 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,  , after a year of waiting patiently for the best of both wireless worlds on my  tungsten t3 i have finally achieved wireless nirvana. my t3 is quickly replacing  my 12and#8221; powerbook as my mobile mail platform of choice thanks to palmone finally  releasing  their palm os 5-compatible wi-fi card.             i waffled a lot before buying the t3 last year after my decrepit palm vx finally croaked. sure the screen is crisp  and colorful and the stretch display and landscape features are appealing and built-in  bluetooth is an isyncing  geekand#8217;s dream - but it was missing a critical component: wi-fi. i could have gone with the wi-fi-enabled tungsten c but  then iand#8217;d give up the stretch display and the bluetooth. itand#8217;s not fair to make me choose between the two wireless  technologies i covet the most! after googling for a few days i found that if i bought the t3 i shouldnand#8217;t have to wait  long to achieve my goals since palmone was *this close* to releasing an 802.11b sdio card for it. i took the  plunge.             months later palmoneand#8217;s promised wi-fi card still nowhere in sight i was kicking myself all the while making the  most of bluetooth but still lamenting the missing wi-fi link. bluetooth works well enough for my needs but to use it  effectively for email on the t3 it required use of my phone the ever-so-stylish  sony ericsson z600. and if i had to use my phone as a bluetooth modem  in order to retrieve the email on my t3 i might as well just check my email on the phone itself. my z600 is a great  phone but itand#8217;s a pretty lousy email appliance. itand#8217;s slow and the screen is way too small and the text input options  are frustrating at best. most importantly i canand#8217;t be on the phone at the same time i am checking my emailandnbsp; -  which is a really tough break for a multitasker like me. :andnbsp; i could just whip out my  airport-enabled powerbook but that isnand#8217;t too convenient in the middle of  union squareandhellip; or in the middle of dinner at  joya.             palmone finally came to my rescue and started shipping their long-overdue wi-fi card 2 weeks ago. within minutes of  tearing it out of the maddeningly stiff and sharp! plastic packaging i was connecting to the internet and checking  email from the comfort of my couch via my airport network using nothing but a pda in the palm of my hand. it was  sooooo worth the wait.             i canand#8217;t go more than a few minutes now without whipping out my t3 and checking for unprotected wireless access points  as i go about my daily travels. i finally get the thrill of war driving - except i am war walking most of the time. and  with palm web pro i can even sign in to my t-mobile hotspot account when i drop into  starbucks for an iced venti skim caramel macchiato without having to unpack.  before my shots are even pulled iand#8217;m downloading email.             there are still some things i canand#8217;t - or wonand#8217;t - do on the palm. blogging for example is tedious on anything smaller  than a powerbookand#8217;s keyboard : so donand#8217;t you worry apple i may get distracted by all the other pretty faces but i  will always come home to you. now i just have to see how the t3 handles  rendezvous! ,3287,10,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/09/22/zen-and-the-art-of-wi-fi-nirvanna/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/09/22/zen-and-the-art-of-wi-fi-nirvanna/,,

price matching or reseller crushing? ,Oct 6 2004 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,  , i really need to stop second-guessing myself. yesterday i was heading over to the  apple store special deals  page and i noticed a new badge above the link to it on the store homepage. the link said simply and#8220;our price  matching policy.and#8221;andnbsp; i did look twice and i was pretty sure apple had never had a price matching policy  but on the other hand i felt certain that if it was new everyone would have been reporting it already since itand#8217;s  pretty big news. so i concluded wrongly that iand#8217;ve just been too darn busy to notice this new policy of appleand#8217;s that  had been so i thought reported already by all the mainstream apple news sites.             turns out i should have gone with my gut instinct because tuesday afternoon i noticed all those other sites reporting  it. my scoop instinct is slipping. oh the shame.             anyway this is major news. at a time when more and more apple resellers are  packing up their powerbooks and going home the last thing they need is to  have apple dig the stake in a little deeper. before apple starting popping up in malls across america independent  apple authorized resellers were the heart of the mac market. they in my opinion helped to make apple what it is  today. in return apple has made it increasingly more difficult for the independents to remain in business.        undercutting them on price in this manner is a real low blow. especially considering that apple resellers are bound  by very strict guidelines regarding advertised prices and have been left with truly pathetic margins on apple hardware  for years now.        if you happen to be an apple reseller reading this iand#8217;d be very curious to hear your take on it. ,1728,3,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/10/06/price-matching-or-reseller-crushing/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/10/06/price-matching-or-reseller-crushing/,,

mac users speak - xm radio listens! ,Nov 21 2004 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,  , about a month ago xm radio opened up their airwaves with a  web stream for subscribers - something that  sirius did a while ago. being an xm subscriber myself i was thrilled to hear of  this development for one very good reason: i canand#8217;t listen to xm in my home due to living in a 2nd floor north-facing  apartment. i kept the subscription because itand#8217;s fun to have on rental-car road trips and my husband could at least use  it in his office. plus i figured my monthly subscription cost was going to a good causeandhellip; anything to drown out the  horror that has become fm radio.             my glee didnand#8217;t last long. i quickly discovered that for unknown reasons xm had decided to make their web stream  microsoft only. i immediately sent a letter to listener services.               i was very excited by your new xm online streaming service until i discovered you have  chosen to exclude mac users from this feature. what is the reason for this? there is windows media player for the mac  and flash player and even internet explorer. i purchased a subscription to xm in may as a birthday present for my  husband. unfortunately we have been unable to listen to it in our own home because we have no direct satellite  exposure from our 2nd floor north-facing apartment. we tried for a few weeks with different antennas and such but were  unable to ever get more that interrupted pockets of static. my husband has slightly better luck in his office with the  xm pc unit we purchased in addition to the delphi home unit. despite the fact that we have been mostly unable to use  the subscription and the equipment we purchased we did not cancel the service in part because we thought it was a  good idea to support xm even if we couldnand#8217;t currently benefit from it. it is sad that you have decided that you donand#8217;t  need to support us in return. one would think that a company that is trying to do something and#8220;differentand#8221; would support  users who have been living by the motto and#8220;think differentand#8221; for 20 years already.    their reply?               we are happy to hear about your interest in xm online.andnbsp; we are sorry but at this  time xm radio online supports microsoft windows only and youandnbsp; will not be able to listen on a macintosh linux  or other non-microsoft environments since internet explorer 6.0 or higher is required.andnbsp; an expansion of xm online  toandnbsp; macintosh has not been announced so we are not aware of if and when this will occur.andnbsp; please accept our  apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.    so much for that ideaandhellip; until friday when xm ammended their system requirents page to include the  following:               note: xm radio online is also usable on many other system configurations including apple macintosh computers and  many other browsers including mozilla firefox netscape and safari. results may vary depending upon your specific  system setup software versions and configuration.    sirius can keep    howard stern whose schtick stopped being funny to me somewhere around the time i graduated from high  school.andnbsp; iand#8217;m xm all the way now.andnbsp; i just added the $3.99 xm  online subscription to my monthly bill.             by the way even if you arenand#8217;t an xm subscriber you can still subscribe to xm online as a standalone for only  $7.99/month.andnbsp; best of all you can try xm online for free with a 3-day trial. ,3489,6,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/11/21/mac-users-speak-xm-radio-listens/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/11/21/mac-users-speak-xm-radio-listens/,,

flash-based ipod: who cares? ,Dec 4 2004 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , john gruber over at daring fireball weighs in on the speculations  circulating about apple releasing a flash-based version of the ipod. he thinks the predictions made by most are based  on an artificial distinction between hard-drive and  flash-based digital music players:                   the problem with this logic is that and#8220;hard-drive playersand#8221; and and#8220;flash-memory playersand#8221; arenand#8217;t actually product    categories. storage mechanisms are implementation details not features. iand#8217;d wager that the vast majority of ipod    owners have no idea whether thereand#8217;s a hard drive in their ipod.      likely true. gruber goes on to assert that making a low-capacity cheaper version of the ipod would be  uncharacteristic for apple because it would undercut the high quality of the ipod brand. it does seem to be moving in  the wrong direction to take a fantastically engineered device and dumb it down to appeal to that market sector that  evaluates price alone as the only factor in purchasing. i mean apple may as well start selling pcs in that case.  ;andgt;                   the point of this is to emphasize that and#8220;flash-memory-basedand#8221; in and of itself is not a feature. if apple is making    an ipod significantly smaller than even the mini it might not be particularly cheap. and if theyand#8217;re making a cheaper    ipod with significantly lower storage capacity theyand#8217;re risking the ipodand#8217;s hard-earned reputation as a terrific    gadget. apple has never indicated that they intend to corner the entire market for mp3 players and#8212; just the market for    good ones.                 no matter what the case if there is a flash memory ipod in the pipeline the fact that it uses flash memory is the    least interesting part of the story.      least interesting to the consumer for sure. but endless fodder for the pundits. : one fine point of disagreement:  gruber thinks and#8216;miniand#8217; is as tiny as apple could go: and#8220;if apple intends to produce ipods even smaller than the mini what  will they call them? ipod tiny?and#8221; i think thereand#8217;s a more obvious name for the mythical device: ipod micro. ,2209,3,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/12/04/flash-based-ipod-who-cares/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/12/04/flash-based-ipod-who-cares/,,

2005: year of the mac? ,Dec 4 2004 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , following apple news lately has been more exciting than most high drama: analysts crowing stock prices soaring  investors trading at high volume stock prices falling again. frankly iand#8217;m exhausted!            spymac columnist michael simon has a take on what it all  means:                through all this two things were apparent: 1 investors are both extremely fickle and impressionable and dangerous    combination when handing millions of dollars a day; and 2 for better or worse wall street is paying close attention    to apple.                sure all eyes are on the ipod but if apple plays its cards right a switcheroo could be just what the doctor    ordered: a marketing push coupled with a few money-saving promotions could easily push mac sales above 1 million in    a quarter for the first time in the companyand#8217;s history. now that the ipod has firmly solidified its position in pop    culture perhaps itand#8217;s time to shift some of its attention back to the real task at hand: selling computers.      iand#8217;m sure that moving more macintosh computers has been part of the strategy underlying heavy ipod marketing.  regardless i think itand#8217;s pretty exciting that the ipod is achieving such success in its own right. after a bit of a  slow start the ipod has become and#8216;the little player that couldand#8217; - and did. all of this buzz and exposure for apple is  bound to bring good things to its computer sales over the long term. could 2005 be the year of the mac? i would  certainly love to see it. ,1547,2,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/12/04/2005-year-of-the-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/12/04/2005-year-of-the-mac/,,

sorry  scott. i still choose safari over firefox for the bulk of my browsing ,Dec 5 2004 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,  , you canand#8217;t read any tech news these days without being  bombarded with the fact that firefox is taking  the browser world by storm. goodie for firefox. itand#8217;s a perfectly fine browser and if i had to work on the windows  platform all day long it would be my sole browser for sure. it kicks ieand#8217;s insecure buggy ass. but on the mac -  safari still rules my browser kingdom.             hereand#8217;s why:             iand#8217;m a speed freak. for me as always your mileage may vary safari is still significantly faster.  and when you are accustomed to command-clicking 20+ tabs open in a matter of seconds speed is important. everyone i  know talks about how fast firefox is. faster than ie and netscape 7 and mozilla sure but itand#8217;s not as fast as safari -  not on my machines at least.             no close widget on each tab. i often want to close tabs that arenand#8217;t active. if the tab is active i  can command+w to close it but if the tab isnand#8217;t active i have to make it active before i can close it. i  hate that.            without using an extension the tab bar  cannot be always in place. thatand#8217;s minor but jarring when you are used to having it always  there as i am with safari. in firefix the tab bar goes away when there is only one tab open. so i downloaded  theandnbsp; extension. but i shouldnand#8217;t have to. it should be a preference. correction: as many  of you have pointed out in your comments there is a preference in the current version of firefox to keep the tab bar  in place when only one tab is open. i donand#8217;t believe that was an option in pre 1.0 versions of firefox and i admittedly  didnand#8217;t notice it there in 1.0 until i just checked. or maybe iand#8217;d missed it all along? regardless i stand corrected.  thanks for pointing it out!             it doesnand#8217;t look like a mac app. i donand#8217;t want to download a bunch of themes to make firefox look like  it belong on my mac. and frankly i think most of those themes suck.             it doesnand#8217;t behave like a mac app. this really annoys meandhellip; when i am in a single-line form field the  address bar or the search box i am accustomed to being able to use my up and down arrow buttons to jump to the  beginning or end of a text entry. firefox ignores the up and down keys in those places. it wastes my time. similarly  command+up has no effect when i want to jump to the top of of page from the bottom or middle for that matter.             i will give firefox credit where credit is due. there are some very cool extensions you can install that enable you to  do some pretty amazing things with firefox. and when i want or need to do those things i switch to firefox for that  session. firefox also works on a handful of sites that safari breaks with the win intranet publishing backend for  example that i am composing this very post in             bottom line: for mac os x i think firefox still has a long was to go before it beats safari. it will be a contender  one day iand#8217;m quite sure of that but itand#8217;s not there yet. until it matures safari will remain my primary browser of  choice. ,3175,2,0,25, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/12/05/sorry-scott-i-still-choose-safari-over-firefox-for-the-bulk/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/12/05/sorry-scott-i-still-choose-safari-over-firefox-for-the-bulk/,,

george mastersand#8217; ipod mini ad has marketing world entranced ,Dec 13 2004 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , turns out the homemade ipod mini ad we posted last  week is causing  quite a stir in the marketing world. experts say it has and#8216;gone viraland#8217; which means that actual people are spreading  the news to each other instead of absorbing it from major media. some say this consumer evangelism will be the future  of advertising:                   and#8220;the ad has caught the attention of marketers who praise its professional production values and say itand#8217;s one of the    first and#8220;pureand#8221; advertisements seen on the internet. though homemade ads are nothing new most are parodies protests or    political commentaries. bruce rubel a vice president at new york pr agency cooperkatz and author of the micro    persuasion web log said evangelistic customers like masters will increasingly play a role in marketing. and#8216;itand#8217;s a sign    that consumers want to have a role in promoting a product they loveand#8217; he said. and#8216;thereand#8217;s a real trend toward    consumer-generated media. people are creating news theyand#8217;re blogging. people will create marketing as well. this guy    is a great example.and#8217;and#8221;         and#8212; leander kahney wired news             i think itand#8217;s less that consumers want to be marketers and more that consumers donand#8217;t want to be consumers. or  rather we donand#8217;t want to be *mere* consumers passively absorbing whatever is dished out by capitalist machinery.  people are creative by nature; give us a platform for self-expression and weand#8217;ll go to town - hence blogging merrily  takes off of its own accord leaving major media scratching its head.             iand#8217;m sure there are folks out there who really enjoy selling things. iand#8217;m not one of them and i doubt that george  masters is either. heand#8217;s not marketing the ipod mini so much as heand#8217;s sharing the love. if it turns out that this  genuine human urge to share may end up trumping some multi-million dollar advertising schemes i wonand#8217;t be terribly  surprised. ,2073,3,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2004/12/13/george-masters-ipod-mini-ad-has-marketing-world-entranced/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2004/12/13/george-masters-ipod-mini-ad-has-marketing-world-entranced/,,

mwsf: an ipod for every car ,Jan 11 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , one of the unforeseen developments at the macworld expo sf this year was the heightened drive towards union between  ipod and car. according to phil schiller appleand#8217;s senior vp of marketing and#8220;almost every car company in the world is  working to integrate ipod into their cars in 2005.and#8221;             apple  announced  today it has struck deals with nissan volvo mercedes-benz usa alfa romeo and ferrari to add ipod integration to  their car stereo systems this year. the mercedes-benz ipod integration kit is set to debut in april with the newly  redesigned 2006 mercedes-benz-m-class. volvo will unleash two ipod options for the entire line of 2005 models in the  us. details on the nissan ferrari and alfa romeo solutions will be forthcoming later this year.             the companies join the ranks of bmw and mini cooper both of whom began offering ipod integration solutions in their  vehicles last year. ,931,2,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/11/mwsf-an-ipod-for-every-car/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/11/mwsf-an-ipod-for-every-car/,,
ipod shuffle: first impressions ,Jan 11 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , christopher breen over at playlistmag.com has  gotten his  hands on the new ipod shuffle the lucky bastard!. he canand#8217;t quite share the shuffle with us but he does the next  best thing and shares his first impressions which i will paraphrase here for your voyeuristic gadgety pleasure.             the shuffleand#8217;s navigation wheel is divided into quadrants with a play/pause button in the center. depress the button  for 3 seconds to switch into hold mode. the east and west quadrants of the nav wheel are the previous/next functions  while north/south is volume up/down. press and hold a previous or next button to rewind or fast-forward respectively.  the shuffle also includes an led indicator that flashes green for and#8216;goodand#8217; and orange for and#8216;do not disconnectand#8217; or and#8216;error.and#8217;  change the ipod from shuffle to sequential playlist button via a slider on the back of the unit. this slider also  functions as power on/off; slide the switch all the way up to turn off the device. so cool.             where it starts to get really interesting is in the integration with itunes. plugging in the ipod shuffle and  selecting it will give you a new pane: the autofill pane. you choose the source of your music album artist playlist  etc. and let the ipod do the rest of the work. you can have it select songs randomly replace all songs and choose  higher-rated songs more often. yet another ingenious way to remix your own music collection courtesy of apple.             another way cool function is the ability to set the shuffleand#8217;s preferences to and#8216;convert higher bit rate songs to 128  kbps aac for this ipod.and#8217; what this does is prevent the shuffle from getting filled up with tracks ripped at higher bit  rates or as uncompressed or lossless audio. itunes will simply perform the conversion as it updates the shuffle. it  adds a bit of time to the sync but well worth it for maximizing the available tunage on your new ipod.             breen takes the time to make one more point: the ipod shuffle is formatted as an ms-dos volume which means youand#8217;ll be  able to let this fresh new device be a swinger in the cross-platform set: no need to reformat to move it between  operating systems.             thanks for the skinny christopher! anyone else get their mitts on one of these babies yet? mine will be here in 5-7  business days. ; ,2418,2,0,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/11/ipod-shuffle-first-impressions/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/11/ipod-shuffle-first-impressions/,,

mwsf: garageband 2: the revenge ,Jan 11 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , gather and#8216;round ye music makers for thereand#8217;s a happy tale to tell of all the new goodies we shall happily find in the  new release of garageband. the biggest news is the addition of multi-track recording capabilities. this little audio  wonder can handle 8 simultaneous tracks of you and yours in riotous cacaphony. look for a lot of aging hipsters on  reunion tours after this puppy ships.               next up we have the classical musicianand#8217;s dream:  garageband will generate musical notation in real time and display it on the fly as you play. this will be a truly  handy tool for composers and songwriters who want to get the ideas out and send off the sheet music to collaborators  and session players. i can also see this feature normally relegated to high-end digital audio workstations or even as  separate add-ons to the big daws being incredibly useful to music educators.             the new garageband comes with a host of new recording  capabilities and post-production enhancements. a built-in tuner will keep those strings honed as you start in on your  session. if you nail a take with the exception of a few tiny errors you can make adjustments to both pitch and  tempo.andnbsp; plus this release adds the ability to generate your own apple loops from your recordings. just record 4  bars of your groove and loop yourself instead of needing multiple takes of your 5 minute track. more available import  formats means you can bring in your midi files and acid loops. throw in some tight integration with ilife and iwork and  youand#8217;ve got a killer low-cost production suite.             last but not least we find a new jam pack  release accompanying garageband 2: jam pack 4: symphony orchestra makes the fourth jam pack package to choose from.  each offers 2000 apple loops and playable software instruments. symphony orchestra adds over 30 of the major orchestral  instruments to your library.             personally iand#8217;m a big fan of loop-based music production and iand#8217;m tickled at the inroads apple has made towards making  music-making intuitive and fun for the layperson. even though everyone has latent natural creative talent not everyone  is encouraged to pursue the knowledge necessary to exercise that creativity. traditionally the cost of the tools of  production has been a major factor in discouraging the average person from creative pursuits. apple is spear-heading a  movement that is not just about and#8216;the digital lifestyleand#8217; - it is about recognizing everybodyand#8217;s inner creative and  discovering the joy of self-expression. apple will reap monetary rewards from all of this oh yes but this is not mere  marketing hype - this is a vision of the future and it is one i can happily and wholeheartedly support. thanks apple  for making it ever-easier to create. ,2856,0,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/11/mwsf-garageband-2-the-revenge/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/11/mwsf-garageband-2-the-revenge/,,

mwsf: mac mini thoughts ,Jan 12 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,  , the mac mini is a reality and a marvel of apple engineering. they  managed to pack a full computer minus the keyboard mouse and monitor into a 2 inch by 6.5. inch by 6.5 inch  container that weighs in at 2.9 pounds and costs either $499 for the 1.25 ghz g4 model or $599 for the 1.42 ghz g4  model.             if you spend the extra hundred dollars you get an 80 gig hard-drive otherwise you will have to settle for 40 gigs  which might not make too much sense if you own a 60 gig ipod photo.             both models include 256 mb of ram as well as the ilife and#8216;05 suite and appleworks. i find both of these inclusions to  be rather odd choices.             it is no secret that os x loves ram so the more the better. why give a machine that is supposed to woo new people to  the mac a largely insufficient amount of ram? if people plan to burn a dvd while listening to itunes and surfing the  net with the base models of the mac mini they are in for a shock.             while we are on the subject of ram i feel i should point out that the mac mini maxes out at 1 gig of ram and that is  all in one slot. this machine is definitely not for a power user so no fear that these will eat into powermac  sales.             and why include appleworks? iworks and#8216;05 was just announced and will be  shipping on the same date that both the mac mini and ilife and#8216;05 will be  january 22nd so why not include iworks with the mac mini instead of the program it is supposed to replace?             however with all that being said you still get  a lot of computer in a little space with the mac mini. i envision a lot of people picking one of these up to serve as a  media server and as a back up machine for their main macs.             as you can see the mac mini has lots to offer in the back as well; from left to right we see the power switch power  in ethernet modem dvi/vga 2 usb 2.0 ports a 400 firewire port and a security slot a very good inclusion since  these things are small and light.             one final note of interest apple points out that you can use a tv with the mac mini as a display either with a dvi  connector or an optional s-video/composite video adapter.             does the mac mini represent appleand#8217;s first steps towards a full fledged set top device? will you be buying one or  more? if not why? leave your thoughts in the comments. ,2384,3,0,24, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/12/mwsf-mac-mini-thoughts/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/12/mwsf-mac-mini-thoughts/,,
gaining my religion: seeing the light of mac ,Jan 13 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , stephen evans pens a fun article for bbc news about the  and#8216;cult of mac.and#8217; he explores what lies behind the and#8216;mundane  functionalityand#8217; of the apple macintosh that gives its users a sense of quasi-religious devotion and damn if steve  doesnand#8217;t look particularly priestly in that photo at right.             evans lists the primary strengths of the macintosh computer as being usability and good looks. both are absolutely  true and yet both are also so often used as arguments *against* the mac which is portrayed as losing a war in which  the only salient metric is functionality. usability and and#8216;styleand#8217; are seen as secondary considerations when in the market  for a personal computer - as if packing more and more difficult to use features into a dull utilitarian box is the  only way to the top of the heap.             this is absolute hogwash as the success of the ipod clearly demonstrates. it is a device that even a six-year-old can  figure out in five minutes. it doesnand#8217;t have an fm tuner. it doesnand#8217;t have voice recording. it doesnand#8217;t brush your teeth  in the morning - and nobody cares; they just want one. because itand#8217;s hip? sure. but moreso because it is so dead easy to  use that it feels more like an extension of yourself than like a cold calculating machine. and that is exactly where  appleand#8217;s marketing team gets everything right.             people are getting bored with lifeless boxes sitting on their desks. whatand#8217;s more weand#8217;re seeing a trend towards  ubiquitous computing that will not stand for devices that look like they donand#8217;t fit into the natural flow of our lives.  the and#8216;good looksand#8217; and and#8216;styleand#8217; of the mac are not simply superficial skins slapped onto technically complicated and  confusing innards: appleand#8217;s explicitly stated goal is to make  complex technology easier to use. and design wisdom tells us that  beautiful things work  better.             when those things start to work so well that they feel more human than machine it starts to feel downright  transcendent. is it any wonder then that mac fanatics approach their computing experience with what amounts to  religious zeal? is there something to it? is your mac a spiritual machine? ,2324,3,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/13/gaining-my-religion-seeing-the-light-of-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/13/gaining-my-religion-seeing-the-light-of-mac/,,
clearing up confusion about the mac mini ,Jan 13 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,  , i spoke with the product manager for the mac mini today to clarify a few  facts.            yes it will boot headless meaning with no display or video device connected enabling you to have what i like    to call an iserve.      while it is strongly recommended that you only have an apple authorized service provider crack it open and    install ram hard drives airport and bluetooth it will not void your warranty if you do it yourself. as is standard    operating procedure however anything you break while attempting anything on your own is not appleand#8217;s responsibility    and will not be covered under warranty. i think that is pretty much common sense.      airport and bluetooth can in fact be added after purchase. airport extreme card and bluetooth module attach to    the mac miniand#8217;s motherboard via a special connector and will be sold together as a kit for    $129.      ram is the most accessible upgrade once you get the case off. that much is clear from the picture.          all upgrades other than ram are not as accessible but accessing them wonand#8217;t void your warranty with list item #2    above in mind.      the reason the top of the mac mini doesnand#8217;t glow and pulse this is my only gripe so far is that there wasnand#8217;t    enough room to light it once the optical drive went in : ,1331,1,0,64, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/13/clearing-up-confusion-about-the-mac-mini/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/13/clearing-up-confusion-about-the-mac-mini/,,
other mp3 vendors miss the point on the ipod shuffle ,Jan 13 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , according to playlistmag.com the  response of other portable audio  players to the ipod shuffle was ho hum. overwhelmingly the response has been essentially that the ipod shuffle  lacks features and therefore wonand#8217;t offer any serious competition to the already established flash player market.             poppycock.             they used the exact same argument to whine about how the original ipod should never have been so popular. it is not  the smallest nor the lightest nor the largest capacity nor the player packed with the most features and yet - sales  figures do not lie. iand#8217;ve said it before and iand#8217;ll  say it again: more features crammed into a confusing interface does not a better player make. this is exactly what the  other mp3 player manufacturers get wrong. when does less become more? when it makes the device easier and more  intuitive to use.             and#8220;but thereand#8217;s no screen!and#8221; so what? i already know whatand#8217;s in my music collection. and if itand#8217;s something iand#8217;ve just  downloaded and i donand#8217;t know who the artist is when i hear it i can look up the lyrics online and find out. this is not  rocket science. back before we knew everything there was a little thing called curiosity. the ipod shuffle? color me  curious. ,1315,4,0,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/13/other-mp3-vendors-miss-the-point-on-the-ipod-shuffle/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/13/other-mp3-vendors-miss-the-point-on-the-ipod-shuffle/,,

killing a mac os x machine ,Jan 15 2005 12:00AM,scott granneman,  , my buddy robert citek has been interested over the last couple of years in ways to kill unix machines. in other  words he tries to create scripts that will bring *nix machines to their knees. his interest isnand#8217;t malicious - heand#8217;s one  of the most honest guys i know - but he thinks that by understanding where the weaknesses are it will better enable  him to shore those up and turn weaknesses into strengths. robert knows linux really really really well actually he  knows rpm-based distros really well; debian-based distros are still something new to him but he bought a mac os x  laptop a year ago so now heand#8217;s focusing on ways to kill mac os x which is still unix remember. hereand#8217;s his latest  report from the cwe-lug mailing list:        andlt;robertand#8217;s emailandgt;        i was able to successfully kill my mac last night with the following script [scott: remove the blank lines from the  script; this blogand#8217;s wysiwyg keeps inserting them]:        perl -le        @foo=qwhello ;       for my $i ; $iandlt;100 ; $i++ {         push@foo @foo || die $i -- no more\n ;         print $i ;       } ;       print size is $#foo ;          by killed i mean that without warning the mac just turned off. when i powered on it took a long time probably  doing an fsck and then the time was set to january 1970. so this was the hardest crash i have ever seen on a unix  box.        so i figured this script would be a good test for ulimit bash ksh ; limit in tcsh csh. but no matter what  setting i used for the various ulimit options the script kept running sucking up more and more ram until i manually  stopped it with a ctrl-c.        iand#8217;m curious to know if the above script kills anyone elseand#8217;s machines and if setting ulimit/limit options prevents  it?        andlt;/robertand#8217;s emailandgt;        jon another member of the cwe-lug list is a big freebsd user and he reported that the script did nothing on his  freebsd box. it ran for 10 seconds or so andamp; things slowed down but then a warning appeared in the terminal - and#8220;out  of memory during request for 1012 bytes total sbrk is 535257088 bytesand#8221; - and things resumed as normal! on openbsd  the script ran for 4 seconds maybe and then gave an and#8220;out of memoryand#8221; error but there was no slowdown in  performance.        what about the rest of you out there? try it - on a non-production machine!!! - andamp; let us know! ,2465,1,0,19, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/15/killing-a-mac-os-x-machine/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/15/killing-a-mac-os-x-machine/,,

power mac g4 cube versus mac mini shootout ,Jan 15 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,  , fellow win blogger glenn fleishman charted a comparison between  the cube and the new mac mini on his personal blog  glennlog. as i am known to do i pounced on it and  added a column to his  chart to better demonstrate the additional benefits of the cube plus added a  price point comparison to  be fair.               although i am the self-appointed leader of the cult of cube i can objectively see how someone who is not so devoted  to their cube might simply replace it with a mac mini. that fact alone  demonstrates the differences in market appeal. the mini is not aimed at people like us. the mini is a switcherand#8217;s dream  come true.             the mini has sex appeal much like the cube but it leaves you wanting more. in all fairness the cube left you  wanting more soon after its release as well more money left in your pocket at the very leastandhellip; lol. but now the cube  can have more.. and moreandhellip; and more.             glenn told me via email that upgrading a power mac g4 tower made much more sense to him than upgrading a cube. if you  donand#8217;t mind the noise and the bulk and the not-as-attractive form factor thatand#8217;s true. but again cube owners are a  different breed. weand#8217;ve only recently come to terms with the fact that running fan-less isnand#8217;t a god-given right and any  upgrade that doesnand#8217;t make us sweat just a little bit probably isnand#8217;t worth doing. the cube offers the thrill of the  chase and the glow of the morning after. you canand#8217;t say that about a g4 tower which is rather generic in comparison. if  you need the most powerful hulking machine money can buy upgrade your existing g4 to the hilt slide the silver tower  under your desk where you can forget about it and be happy. or buy a shiny new g5 and enjoy it. if you fall into either  of those camps the mac mini is still not aimed at you but the cube at least comes a little closer. plus a  not-so-surprising number of us loyal cube owners have already upgraded our cubes and have been keeping  up with the joneses quite well. the fact that after all this time there are still new upgrades made specifically for us  speaks volumes. companies like owc and  powerlogix and sonnet and  giga and mce and  fastmac keep pumping out cube-compatible and cube-specific accelerators and  optical drives and even new enclosures. there are sellers on ebay who specialize in nothing but cube-compatible video  cards and make a brisk living doing so. will the mac mini sold today have as many options available to it 4 years from  now? iand#8217;m inclined to think not.             the mini is a good value if it suits your needs and it will suit the needs of many many people. it will look nice next  to my cube and it will make a nice home server but my cube will continue overpower it subject to change when/if the  mini sees rev 2 and continue to bring me greater degrees of personal computer satisfaction.             there you have it folks. the cube vs mac mini argument is the new mac vs pc argument : ,3050,12,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/15/power-mac-g4-cube-versus-mac-mini-shootout/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/15/power-mac-g4-cube-versus-mac-mini-shootout/,,

dell not impressed with ipod or mac mini ,Jan 17 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,  , dell ceo kevin rollins    thinks the ipod is a fad the mac mini    wonand#8217;t hurt delland#8217;s sales and that apple is not in the same league as dell but he meant it in the nicest way    possible.                drawing parallels between the ipod and sonyand#8217;s walkman he says and#8216;when i was growing up there was a product made by    sony called the sony walkman andndash; a rage everyone had to have one. well you donand#8217;t hear about the walkman anymore. i    believe that one product wonders come and go. you have to have sustainable business models sustainable    strategy.and#8217;                if you ignore the itunes music store the thriving 3rd party ipod accessories business and the fact that the digital    music player market hasnand#8217;t been saturated yet then mr. rollins makes a good point. i do find it odd that he doesnand#8217;t    make one mention of the dell music dj though which seems to be in the same market as the ipod but not so    popular.                the mac mini most likely will not make a serious dent in delland#8217;s market share because dell is concentrating on    business sales a market that the mac mini certainly isnand#8217;t targeted at.                after disparaging apple new products mr. rollins makes nice and says and#8216;theyand#8217;ve apple done a nice job.and#8217; ,1350,1,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/17/dell-not-impressed-with-ipod-or-mac-mini/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/17/dell-not-impressed-with-ipod-or-mac-mini/,,

installing oracle 10g on your mac ,Jan 19 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,  , on december 22rd 2004 oracle released its flagship product  oracle database 10g for  mac os x server. this is an important release for apple since you can not  compete in the enterprise market without the ability to run oracle on your hardware. getting oracle ported to os x was  a coup no doubt helped along by the fact that his steveness and oracle chairman and ceo  larry ellison are bosom buddies.             the good news is that you donand#8217;t need os x server or an xserve to run  oracle on your mac; plain old os x works fine of course i wouldnand#8217;t recommend trying to rollout an oracle  implementation to users running on a flower power imac.             sergio leunissen a product team member on oracleand#8217;s  htmldb product is a mac user and he  has written up some very good instructions on how to  get oracle 10g up and running on your mac. they may look intimidating at first but if you follow them closely and the  terminal doesnand#8217;t frighten you it is fairly painless.             you can read up about oracle 10g on the mac at appleand#8217;s  website and you can download  oracle 10g for the mac at oracleand#8217;s website. ,1164,11,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/19/installing-oracle-10g-on-your-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/19/installing-oracle-10g-on-your-mac/,,

ipod shuffle not compatible with emac or imac g3 ,Jan 20 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , the ipod shuffle is small enough to go where no mp3 players have gone before but  it wonand#8217;t be going in your emac or your imac g3. the  physical limitations imposed by the placement of the usb ports on those models and quite possibly other machines with  recessed or tightly spaced usb ports make it impossible for the shuffle to plug into them. in order to reach the  ports users will have to purchase an extra accessory.             luckily many folks will already have on hand one possible piece of equipment for connecting the shuffle: a usb hub.  other possibilities for syncing and charging the ipod include the ipod shuffle dock or a usb extension cable. the  latter is a relatively inexpensive item and both it or the usb would come in handy as a general item in oneand#8217;s toolkit.  one other option that will enable syncing though not charging of the unit is to plug it into a keyboardand#8217;s usb ports  if the machine is running os x 10.3.6 or later.             it would have been nice for apple to have mentioned that little nuisance so that emac and imac g3 owners could have  been warned they would need an extra accessory. is anyone miffed? feel free to vent here. ,1195,1,0,18, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/20/ipod-shuffle-not-compatible-with-emac-or-imac-g3/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/20/ipod-shuffle-not-compatible-with-emac-or-imac-g3/,,

the mac mini: media hub for itunes movie store? ,Jan 21 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , robert cringely is a true tech sleuth. this week he  puts together the puzzle pieces to surmise what the  mac mini is truly about. right now it is about design innovation and a strong pitch to disgruntled windows users  and potential switchers but cringely thinks jobs has an ace up his sleeve and the full potential of the mac mini has  yet to be unveiled.             what do we know? we know that as much as steve jobs reputedly disparages video he has clearly announced 2005 as  and#8220;the year of hd.and#8221; we also know that apple is in bed  with sony as evidenced by sony president kunitake andoand#8217;s  appearance at the macworld keynote. as cringely dryly points out: and#8220;you donand#8217;t get the head of sony at your event  just to sell camcorders.and#8221;             we also know that within two days of reporting the release of  iflicks which we dubbed and#8220;itunes for videoand#8221; the site  was mysteriously taken down and nobody can talk  about why. perhaps theyand#8217;ve been purchased by a company who is extremely  adamant about locking down information about advance  products?             what is apple playing at? i think cringely is onto something hot: apple will jump-start the hd movie business  bypassing cable monopolies and offering itunes-type simplicity for delivering high-quality digital movie content to the  mac mini home theater. ,1387,7,0,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/21/the-mac-mini-media-hub-for-itunes-movie-store/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/21/the-mac-mini-media-hub-for-itunes-movie-store/,,

one-button mouse: simple success or tired relic? ,Jan 29 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , the mac is often much-maligned and falsely so for not supporting the two-button mouse. we all know the fact of the  matter is apple has supported the two-button mouse since os 8.6 and never hesitate to dispel the myth - yet we also  turn around and secretly scratch our heads over why apple doesnand#8217;t just start shipping two-button mice standard with  their machines already.             gear live contributor andru writes a  missive in  defense of the one-button mouse. his three main pillars are as follows:            the majority of computer users donand#8217;t use the two-button mouse on either platform and#8221;giving the average person a    right mouse button is like giving a bald man a comb.and#8221;.      it encourages developers to stick to the apple standard of providing a way to access all application functions    from a single mouse click in a menu.      the un-average user who will desire a two-button mouse will more often than not chuck out their two-button and go    with some higher order of multi-button mouse anyway. why bother sending a two-button then?                 admittedly two-button mousing is a whole new world. but i can definitely see the argument for simplicity for the  *average* user of which i am not one. whatand#8217;s your verdict - is apple wise with the zen of the one-button mouse or is  it time to ship the double-clickers already? ,1390,1,0,31, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/29/one-button-mouse-simple-success-or-tired-relic/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/01/29/one-button-mouse-simple-success-or-tired-relic/,,

ipod shuffle: your first or second portable audio player? ,Feb 2 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , have been pondering this discussion and  csipodand#8217;s words about the ipod shuffle. it  occurs to me to wonder: to those of you who are buying the shuffle - are you buying it as your first portable audio  player or as an addition to an already existing collection of ipods/portable music players?             i am sure there will be a lot of first-time ipod buyers who go in for the shuffle because of its low price and  because letand#8217;s face it the thing is trendy not to mention irresistibly cute. but i also have a hunch a lot of folks  will buy this as an addition to their existing arsenal.            after having used the shuffle for a week or so i notice that i just use it and think of it differently from how i  think about its big sister ipod. the 40gb ipod holds a collection of music as well as contacts notes recent rss  feeds file storage etc. it has a surprising number of uses for a and#8220;music player.and#8221; the ipod shuffle on the other hand  is concerned with one thing and one thing alone: dump a selection of fresh and randomly-selected music every day and go  to town. some will and do look at that as and#8220;limited functionality.and#8221; i look at it as relief. i donand#8217;t have to sync it  with 8 different apps every time i dock it. i donand#8217;t have to even bother craning my neck in the car or pulling it out of  my pocket to see who the artist is - if i donand#8217;t know already i am simply left to smile at the mystery and  unexpectedness that is life and enjoy the experience of the music itself divorced from its metadata and perhaps do a  little hunting online later on and learn something new. hokey maybe and not for everyone - but thatand#8217;s my  personality. i enjoy the unexpected. i enjoy being reminded that i donand#8217;t actually know everything - yet. ;        i sort of think of the shuffle as the best friend who steals into your room in the middle of the night and ransacks  your music collection to make you a marvelously cool new mix tape ready for you each morning. the mix tape on  steroids with infinite permutations.             so - how do you find the shuffle? do you think it works equally well as a first portable audio solution? do you find  it makes a fantastic addition to your audio collection? let us know! ,2301,2,0,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/02/ipod-shuffle-your-first-or-second-portable-audio-player/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/02/ipod-shuffle-your-first-or-second-portable-audio-player/,,

ipod shuffle: more thoughts whilst!,Feb 4 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , as you may come to notice i enjoy spreading out my product reviews over time. it takes more time to get to know a  product than i can possibly do in the span of a few days and cough up one monolithic review. youand#8217;ll see monolithic  reviews too but certain products lend themselves to new and changing thoughts over time.             the ipod shuffle is one such product. i carry it with me every day and have been using it almost constantly since  it arrived. some more thoughts:            i ended up losing the lanyard before i lost the end cap. go figure.      battery life is quite nice. itand#8217;s one of the few devices i own that i end up remembering to charge at some point    before the battery dies. i canand#8217;t tell you the maximum play time iand#8217;ve seen because i havenand#8217;t yet run the battery    completely down despite leaving it play for hours and hours all the time.      the on/off switch in the back is pretty clever but one drawback: itand#8217;s very difficult to manipulate with a gloved    hand. all very well when designed in california not so well when used in upstate ny in the middle of winter! :      i wish that whenever i plugged it in to the machine itand#8217;s paired with my titanium e.g. i would first get an    option about whether i want to sync it or just charge it. i like the sync function and donand#8217;t want to turn it off    but if i need to charge it when iand#8217;m out and about it will resync the same playlist thatand#8217;s already on it - which is    bad because the drive my mp3s live on is not connected to my laptop. i end up with a paltry subset of the music that    was already on the shuffle and should never have been removed.      i really really want a function available from my browsers that is and#8220;send to shuffleand#8221; - right-click a url to an    audio file and automagically send it to the shadow    shuffle to be synced next time i plug it in.                 anybody else have any wishes for ipod shuffle or shuffle integration features? ,2041,3,0,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/04/ipod-shuffle-more-thoughts-wishlist/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/04/ipod-shuffle-more-thoughts-wishlist/,,

next question: *tagged* note taker? ,Feb 14 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , i want to thank everyone for all the suggestions in  this thread regarding tabbed text editors.  unfortunately nothing is exactly *it* - but iand#8217;ve been using  textwrangler over the weekend and i think it will end up in  my arsenal anyway even though itand#8217;s not technically everything iand#8217;m looking for. the drop-down menu for accessing files  instead of tabs is a close second. plus you canand#8217;t beat free. :            but i have yet another question for your collective knowledge wisdom. the fatal flaw with keeping text files of notes  is that once you close them you canand#8217;t search them. i know that  spotlight will address this but gol-darnit i hate  waiting. on the other hand the fatal flaw with knowledge collectors like devonthink and stickybrain is that they keep  your files in proprietary databases that you have to remember to backup and/or export periodically. try as i might i  can never seem to and#8216;rememberand#8217; to do these sorts of periodic actions.            so my new question is two-fold: are there any note collector/research-oriented apps that collect and store files in  standard formats yet keep them always searchable? part two is: are there any note-taking apps that allow you to  organize your notes by tagging them instead of by placing them in hierarchies? by tagging i mean an easy way to attach  any number of non-hierarchical attributes to a note the way that flickr and  del.icio.us allow you to do. if something like this exists for os x i would probably  switch to it in a heartbeat.            again thanks in advance for any suggestions! ,1617,6,0,16, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/14/next-question-tagged-note-taker/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/14/next-question-tagged-note-taker/,,

cell processor may not be an easy sell to apple ,Feb 24 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,  , we all know that the latest and great processor in the mac world is the  g5. made by ibm and used by apple in its high end  powermacs these processors pack some serious punch. recently ibm sony  and toshiba announced that they are jointly working on something called the  cell  processor which will be making its debut in sonyand#8217; playstation 3.            ibm went to great pains to point out that the new cell processor which at the moment clocks in atandnbsp; speeds up to  4ghz is powerpc compatible fueling suspicions that  apple may adopt this new chip for its computers.            eweekand#8217;s john rizzo has written an  excellent article detailing why he doesnand#8217;t think that  apple will be using the cell anytime soon. he points out that while it might be trivial to get os x to run on a cell  processor tweaking the os to make it run faster on the new processor will take a long time and a lot money. also the  celland#8217;s core is much simpler than the one found in the g5; it is only capable of issuing 2 instructions at a time while  the current g5 can issue 4 times as many.            all of that information can be found on the first page alone of the three page article; this article is dense folks.  rizzo builds a solid case and he has convinced me that apple will most likely not be using the cell processor any time  soon. ,1362,7,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/24/cell-processor-may-not-be-an-easy-sell-to-apple/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/24/cell-processor-may-not-be-an-easy-sell-to-apple/,,
freeware february: sogudi ,Feb 24 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,  , sogudi is a  safari add on that has the potential of saving me a large amount of time.  this little freeware gem allows you to type a and#8216;shortcutand#8217; instead of an url in the location field of safari.        for example letand#8217;s say youand#8217;re a frequent tuaw reader and you visit the site roughly 50 times a day. some might ask  you why you donand#8217;t simply bookmark tuaw instead of typing http://apple.weblogsinc.com every time you want to visit the  site a more astute friend would suggest that you at least use the shorter http://www.tuaw.com but if i mention that  it undermines my example. sogudi allows you to create a shortcut to tuaw so that you need only type tuaw into the  location field and boom tuaw is on your screen.        this alone isnand#8217;t all that exciting however the real power of sogudi is in the fact that you can use variables. in  the screen shot you can see i typed in and#8216;wikip apple computer.and#8217; wikip is the shortcut for  wikipedia the online encyclopedia that is all the rage now.  wikipedia urland#8217;s are always structured in the same way much like google urland#8217;s so sogudi stores the address as  and#8216;http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=@@@and#8217; where the @@@ is a place holder forandnbsp; your variable. you just  type in wikip followed by a space which alerts sogudi that the rest of the text entered is the variable and the term  you want to search for and youand#8217;re done.        very cool. ,1501,3,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/24/freeware-february-sogudi/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/02/24/freeware-february-sogudi/,,

1gb of .mac for $50 more a year ,Mar 1 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, i think the reality of the 1gb of web-hosted space offered  through .mac didnand#8217;t really hit me until i returned from my honeymoon with 87mbs of hawaii  pictures and not enough room to upload them for my family to see. my friend jason  had mentioned that he had upgraded his account several weeks ago and was screaming in ichat about what a great deal it  was. i was happy about the upgrade from 100mb to 250mb when apple originally announced the change but still resentful  about my original .mac email that was free under itools holding me hostage for $99 a year when it switched to a pay  system under .mac.andnbsp; as a result the jump to 1gb for $50 extra didnand#8217;t really click in my head until now. sure i  could probably set up my own server with far more space on a mac mini but in the interum $50 for my family in  mississippi to see the honeymoon is a steal. ,882,2,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/01/1gb-of-mac-for-50-more-a-year/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/01/1gb-of-mac-for-50-more-a-year/,,

evolutiontv ,Mar 1 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, itand#8217;s a little expensive weighing in at $279  and shipping in mid-march but the  evolutiontv is the newest addition to my  ever-growing technolust list.andnbsp; this coupled with an over-clocked mac mini might just be my new entertainment hub.  elgato already has eyetv out on the market as a  competitor but evolutiontv has the added bonus of ripping the shows straight to mpeg-2/4 and  divx along with titantv compatibility and ical integrated scheduling. the  straight-to-divx option means i can record more shows on less disk space which is great for mobile viewing on my  12-inch powerbook and its aluminum case will nicely match all of appleand#8217;s current gear. also unlike my current pvr  setup using my replaytv box to capture shows and then transfering them to my mac with  mreplay using evolutiontv to convert the video directly to mpeg-4 means i  can drag the o.c. directly over to imovie 5 to edit out the commercials and burn to dvd then  i can make copies of the dvd and go sell the copies on the  streets of manhattan for $10 a pop....er i mean copy those shows on tv land that  will never be released on dvd...no wait i mean  copy that educational show i saw on pbs over to a dvd after making a substantial donation to the continued  funding of public broadcasting. *cough cough* ,1308,6,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/01/evolutiontv/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/01/evolutiontv/,,

how to copy your dvds / cds in os x: part 1 ,Mar 1 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, i need to begin this entry by noting that this information  could be used for nefarious illegal purposes.andnbsp; that being said there is nothing inherently illegal in  this idea.andnbsp; it is simply using a loophole in the system that allows you to make a legal fair use backup of every  dvd or cd you buy or own. dcdan wrote a basic tutorial on how to do this a  few weeks ago and i thought iand#8217;d expand upon this to explain the system i use regularly.        first the legal issues involved: you own your dvd / cd.andnbsp; under fair use laws you should be able to  make a copy of said dvd / cd for backup purposes. however most dvds / cds this day come with some sort of digital  rights management drm encoding that acts as a first line of defense preventing you from copying the disk to your  hard drive. any attempts to break the code of or circumnavigate drm is considered illegal. fortunately for us os x  pantherand#8217;s disk utility located in /applications/utilities/ is capable of making disk images of most  mountable disks drm and all. simply launch disk utility insert the disk you want to copy select the diskand#8217;s mounted  name in the sidebar of disk utility and go to imagesand#8212;andgt;newand#8212;andgt;new image from device or the mounted name of your  disk. note: for certain store-bought cds this no longer works.andnbsp; easy work around: rip the cd into itunes  burn a new copy then make an image of that copy.andnbsp; this has the same effect using a loophole and still avoids any  unlawful breaking of the drm.andnbsp; since the drm is copied you arenand#8217;t technically attempting to break the code  and therefore you arenand#8217;t really breaking the law.andnbsp; instead you are merely exercising your fair use rights. now if  you decided to take this information and make a copy for your friend or start making multiple copies to sell on the  streets of manhattan at $10 a pop then you are breaking the law.andnbsp; donand#8217;t do it. of course if you are a  criminal you probably figured your way around all this drm business long ago which of course underscores how  incredibly silly and inconvenient drm is for the average law-abiding end user.        in part two of this post iand#8217;ll get into the nitty-gritty how-to of all the different things you can do some legal  some of questionable legality once youand#8217;ve made this image.andnbsp; check back later. ,2425,1,1,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/01/how-to-copy-your-dvds-cds-in-os-x-part-1/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/01/how-to-copy-your-dvds-cds-in-os-x-part-1/,,

playlist mag gives appleand#8217;s ipod shuffle sport case 4 stars ,Mar 2 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,  , our friends at playlist are one of the first if not the  first to get their hands on appleand#8217;s new sport case for the  ipod shuffle. although announced at macworld in january the cases have only recently begun to ship.             playlist gives the case 4 stars out of  5 although they do note a few quirks that would in my eyes make it 3 star material. the case looks stylish and  is said to do a fine job of protecting your shuffle from the and#8220;everyday risks of scratches bumps and dropsand#8221;  and the elements like water - a claim that apple themselves doesnand#8217;t even make - but what it adds in protection it  takes away in accessibility.andnbsp; when your shuffle is in the case the off/play/shuffle switch is completely covered  and the lanyard is no longer an option but a required fixture. the lack of a belt clip configuration as playlist also  points out is a poor choice for those of us that prefer not to wear our ipods around our necks. appleand#8217;s omission in  this area strikes me as odd since itand#8217;s targeted at the athletic crowd. most gym-goers that i know donand#8217;t want anything  around their necks while theyand#8217;re moving around except a towel and most joggers i know donand#8217;t want anything bouncing  against their chest.             for $30 itand#8217;s not a bad deal but i personally recommend something along the lines of the  shuffleclip unless you have an urge to wear your shuffle in the  shower.        - corrected to reflect the actual number of stars awarded. i swear i counted 5 stars when i looked the first time!  must have been that second glass of wine. sorry dan! ,1648,4,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/02/playlist-mag-gives-apples-ipod-shuffle-sport-case-4-stars/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/02/playlist-mag-gives-apples-ipod-shuffle-sport-case-4-stars/,,

how to copy your dvds / cds in os x: part 2 ,Mar 2 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, yesterday i started introducing you to the amazing disk copying  capabilities of disk utility.andnbsp; after you choose to create an image from device a dialog will come up with several  options while asking you for the location to save the resulting .dmg file. you have the option of selecting an image  format and a type of encryption.andnbsp; for simple backup purposes like copying cds and dvds there is no real reason to  select any encryption; however i use this option regularly to back up financial documents and other sensitive bits  reserved for my eyes only.andnbsp; choosing encryption will prompt you for a password which you must submit in the  future whenever attempting to mount the image.        under and#8220;image formatand#8221; you have the option to select read/write read-only compressed or  dvd/cd master. for our purposes here dvd/cd master is the best choice as it is the most conducive to  burning copies of the disk. i tend to avoid using the compressed option as it tends to slow down mounting of  the disk image substantially; if i need the file to be compressed i usually simply right click on the .dmg file and  choose create archive to wrap it up in a zip file.andnbsp;        now whenever you need to create a replacement disk for that installation cd that has been sitting in the bottom of  your desk drawer sliding around with your thumb tacks scratching it into oblivion simply launch disk utility drag  the dvd/cd master dmg file over into its sidebar select the image file in the sidebar and click the burn button.        now if youand#8217;ve made a backup copy of a commercial dvd you will often find that the image weighs in at a much larger  footprint than the 4.7gbs supported by your macand#8217;s superdrive.andnbsp; you can still mount this image and play it like any  other dvd; however if you want to actually make a burned dvd copy of the disk then you have to go through a slightly  different procedure which i will discuss in tomorrowand#8217;s installment.andnbsp; check back then. ,2037,1,0,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/02/how-to-copy-your-dvds-cds-in-os-x-part-2/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/02/how-to-copy-your-dvds-cds-in-os-x-part-2/,,

will the next mac mini include an ipod dock? ,Mar 2 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , leo bodnar the same intrepid soul who overclocked his  mac mini continued his sleuthwork and has uncovered an unused firewire bus in the ultra ata-100 riser card that  connects the miniand#8217;s optical drive to the motherboard. whatand#8217;s up with this vestigial firewire connector? leo thinks the  riser was designed to feed an ipod dock connector built in to the top cover of the mini. whether the feature was  originally built in and then dropped or whether this foretells the advent of an ipod dock-enabled mac mini or whether  this is all pure shinola for that matter is unknown. but considering that  not a single ipod now ships with a dock as a standard  accessory it sure would be mighty convenient if the next revision of the mac mini arrives sporting an ipod dock.            next imagine hooking your video ipod since steve  keeps adamantly poo-pooing it itand#8217;s bound to happen in to your mac mini dock and sucking down the video content youand#8217;ve  just downloaded from the imovies store. how cool  would that be? ,1042,4,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/02/will-the-next-mac-mini-include-an-ipod-dock/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/02/will-the-next-mac-mini-include-an-ipod-dock/,,
mac n00b / switcher tip: print screen ,Mar 2 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, the other day one of my coworkers called me up with this question so i thought i would share it here. she wanted  to know if there was a mac function similar to the print screen button on windoze.andnbsp; in peecee land for those of  you who donand#8217;t know the print screen button on the keyboard copies the content of the current screen so that it can be  pasted into a document or program for editing printing etc.andnbsp; in mac there is an easy key combination to achieve  the same effects and more.andnbsp; simply hit the command key the apple key next to the space bar the shift key and  the number 3 key simultaneously.andnbsp; this takes a screen shot of the current screen and saves it to the desktop as a  pdf file.             now if you only want to copy a segment of the screen hit command + shift + 4 and the mouse cursor will change from  an arrow into cross hairs.andnbsp; simply click and drag the cross hairs over the area of the screen of which you want to  take a picture.andnbsp; when you release the mouse button you will hear a clicking sound reminiscent of a camera shutter  and a new file will appear on your desktop in pdf format.andnbsp; most macs these days come with a free copy of  graphicconverter which you can use to convert the resulting pdf  file into jpeg gif png or whatever image format you like the best.andnbsp; have fun!        update: dave notes in the comments: and#8220;for even more fun once you use cmd + shift + 4 press the  space bar and the cursor turns into a camera. move over any window and you can take a snapshot of just that window. :and#8221;  thanks dave!            and#8217;nother update: df adds and#8220;if you add the control key to any of the os x screenshot keyboard shortcuts the  screenshot is copied to the clipboard instead of being saved to a file; you can then paste it into any graphics  application and#8212; such as os xand#8217;s preview and#8212; and save it in any format you prefer.and#8221; thanks df! ,1985,1,3,12, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/02/mac-n00b-switcher-tip-print-screen/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/02/mac-n00b-switcher-tip-print-screen/,,

xserve raid powered byandhellip; intel?! ,Mar 3 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,  , for years people have suggested that apple  would fare much better if they ported their os to the intel platform. the reasoning  goes something like this:            there are lots of intel boxes out here.      people donand#8217;t like windows.      lots of people would buy appleand#8217;s os.      apple is the new microsoft      world peace.          to settle this debate let me say this: porting os x to intel is a horrible idea and apple will never do it.  however that is not to say apple would never use an intel chip because it appears intel is an integral part of  appleand#8217;s xserve raid.            according to cnet the  xserve raid makes use of inteland#8217;s iop 331 chip which is used in many similar raid devices from such companies as  ibm and dell.            this proves one thing and one thing only; intel will continue to make lots of money for the foreseeable future. ,898,5,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/03/xserve-raid-powered-by-intel/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/03/xserve-raid-powered-by-intel/,,

how to copy your dvds in os x: part 3 ,Mar 3 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, yesterday i discussed making master disk images  of your cds / dvds in disk utility.andnbsp; now for the final installment of this trilogy of posts iand#8217;ve done away with  the cd aspect and will be focusing on how to copy those larger-than-4.7gb dvds you own to another dvd.             i should warn you first that whereas the previous methods mentioned here avoid tampering with drm digital rights  management and therefore remain more or less legal the method i am about to outline becomes illegal if you use it to  copy a commercial disk with drm protection even if you are trying to legally exercise your fair use rights.  this is a huge problem with drm: it interferes with your rights as a consumer.andnbsp; so going into this you now know  two things: 1. this could be ruled illegal in a court of law. 2. drm is bad because it infringes on your fair  use rights.             hereand#8217;s the possibly illegal step you will have to take should the dvd be either drm-protected or region-encoded for a  region that is different from what your dvd player currently supports.andnbsp; get a copy of  dvdbackup.andnbsp; this free program copies the content of your  dvd to a video_ts folder on your hard drive and in the process of copying the files can strip them of drm and / or  region-encoding. itand#8217;s fairly simple to operate. read the read me. read the warnings.andnbsp; run the program.              now you have to find a way to compress  that video_ts folder and burn it back to a 4.7gb dvd-r disk. this can be done simply and effectively though in a fair  amount of processor-number-crunching time by roxioand#8217;s  popcorn $50. drag and drop the video_ts folder you created with dvdbackup into popcorn click the and#8220;burnand#8221; button  throw in a blank dvd-r and popcorn starts compressing the video files from your dvd into the highest quality format  that will fit onto a 4.7gb disk.andnbsp; the resulting dvd will have all the same functionality extra tracks special  features and subtitles that the original dvd had but with a slightly lesser video quality.             thatand#8217;s it! now you can copy nearly every dvd that comes your way. now if youand#8217;re interested in copying the dvd into a  compressed formatand#8212;i donand#8217;t knowand#8212;perhaps so you can have multiple movies loaded up on your portable mac for the next long  plane ride you have youand#8217;re going to want to use one of the many tools available to rip the dvd to divx. maybe iand#8217;ll  write something about that in the future.andnbsp; in the meantime google it. ,2597,3,0,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/03/how-to-copy-your-dvds-in-os-x-part-3/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/03/how-to-copy-your-dvds-in-os-x-part-3/,,

switcher question:  if not word  then what? ,Mar 3 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, in the  comments to my last mac n00b post jj asks:  and#8220;if microsoft is so bad what do you guys use for a word processor?and#8221; he then goes on to say that appleworks  openoffice.org via x11 and abiword  all fail to please him for various reasons.        unfortunately i inevitably end up having to use word sometimes. but if you like ooo and are just having  trouble with the x11 implementation of it in os x theyand#8217;ve actually end-of-lifed os x development of ooo you might  find neooffice/j appealing. itand#8217;s a non-x11 dependent java-based port of ooo for  os x that is still in development and integrates rather nicely with os x although much of the interface still looks  like an ugly windows app.        any other suggestions for jj? ,761,4,0,18, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/03/switcher-question-if-not-word-then-what/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/03/switcher-question-if-not-word-then-what/,,

safari needs saft ,Mar 3 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, if you are an avid safari user youand#8217;re going to want to purchase  saft to fully trick out your browser of choice.  saft version 7.5.5 has just been announced and has a long list of useful features for a single safari  plug-in including full-screen browsing searchable bookmarks and history url shortcuts kiosk mode and  my absolute favorite crash protection and tabbed browsing memory.andnbsp; this means that if you accidentally close out  safari with 5 different tabs open simply relaunching opens up all the tabs you were using in your last session.            if you install the demo saft will give you a warning every time you launch safari telling you to  purchase the full version.andnbsp; i used the demo for about a week before i dropped the $12 via paypal to  grab my copy.andnbsp; that was a year ago and iand#8217;ve never regretted the choice.            sure some of these features are built into firefox or available via plug-ins for free but so far i  havenand#8217;t seen a solution free or otherwise for the little os x nuances that firefox lacks and which make  safari my preferred browser. ,1118,1,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/03/safari-needs-saft/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/03/safari-needs-saft/,,

the skinny on the new powerbook motion sensor ,Mar 4 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,  , amit singh has posted a  fascinating article about the new powerbook sudden motion  sensor sms that is now standard in all powerbooks. this is  the little feature that senses is the powerbook has been dropped or moved suddenly and stops the hard drive in hopes of  preventing damage to the drive. i am sure even if you have a powerbook with this feature dropping it is a terrifying  experience.             the sms might be too sensitive for some users. amit reports that loud thumping bass seems to trigger the sms and  spins down the disks. if you are using a powerbook to pump out said techno beats you might want to check out amitand#8217;s  tip on disabling this feature because nothing stops a rave faster than a skipping track.             amit has also built a few applications that take advantage of the information that the sensor reports on and  demonstrates what can be done with the sensors. ,906,3,1,5, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/04/the-skinny-on-the-new-powerbook-motion-sensor/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/04/the-skinny-on-the-new-powerbook-motion-sensor/,,
gracenote knows what you listen to  but is anybody worried? ,Mar 5 2005 12:00AM,barb dybwad,  , bob sullivanand#8217;s msnbc article is trying to pin some privacy issues  on appleand#8217;s ipod and theyand#8217;re not sticking. it talks about the gracenote cddb the database that lives behind the scenes  and gets queried every time you put a cd into your computer to fetch the metadata associated with the disc: artist  album names track names genre et al. the issue is being framed as one of privacy because gracenote stores the  queries sent to it and uses them to compile aggregate music listening preference data. however even if this data were  to be tied to individual ip addresses which get discarded after use in determining geolocation-based and#8220;top 10and#8221; data  it would be impossible to pinpoint individual persons to target them based on it. furthermore framing this as an issue  somehow created by the advent of the ipod is disingenuous because gracenote really has nothing to do with appleand#8217;s  famed portable audio device nor any devices made by other makers and#8212; it comes into play any time you put a music cd into  your desktop or laptop. gracenote doesnand#8217;t know whether youand#8217;ve ripped the cd or not as erroneously stated in the  article.             msnbc also wrongly invokes the leering specter of the riaa who could not extract any information about illegal music  downloading from gracenote if they tried and#8212; gracenote doesnand#8217;t have any way of ascertaining the legality of an inserted  disc. they even trot out the opinion of washington post reporter robert oand#8217;harrow to up the ante on the fear-mongering  despite the fact that he admits to not having studied the gracenote cddb. he says he and#8220;fears the chilling effect that  could be produced if people know someone else knows their musical tastes.and#8221; i bet he only listens to britney spears with  the car windows rolled wayyyyy up. ,1880,2,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/05/gracenote-knows-what-you-listen-to-but-is-anybody-worried/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/05/gracenote-knows-what-you-listen-to-but-is-anybody-worried/,,
alac decoder for apple lossless files ,Mar 5 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, /. reports about  alac decoder by david hammerton which is a basic decoder for  apple lossless audio codec files alac. this early version has the limitation of only being able to handle 16 bit  sample sizes and mono or stereo alac files which can normally handle up to 8 different channels for surround sound  goodness. alac decoder can output the decoded file into either pcm or wav files.andnbsp; slashdot explains why this may  be of interest to some of you and#8221;this allows users of operating systems not supported by itunes/quicktime to listen  to their apple lossless files a proprietary competitor to flac. this is a large leap forward in audio codec  interoperability and paves the way for an alac encoder.and#8221; so basically if youand#8217;re one of those crazy people who  have a dual-install of os x and yellow dog linux you can now export you apple lossless encoded file to a format you  can listen to on linux. if anybody gives this a shot comment and let us know how the sound turns out after  conversion. ,1028,2,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/05/alac-decoder-for-apple-lossless-files/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/05/alac-decoder-for-apple-lossless-files/,,

the trouble with troubleshooting os x ,Mar 7 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, ted landau the godfather of apple troubleshooting and founder of  macfixit posts a thorough discussion of whatand#8217;s  right and wrong with os x in terms of troubleshooting with a hands-on discussion of a printer troubleshooting  session. much of the reason that troubleshooting is difficult in os x is because apple doesnand#8217;t publicly document how  all of os xand#8217;s innards work.andnbsp; ted gives the following as an example: mdj  attempts to document the undocumented and in covering the recent 10.3.8 update they note that apple fails to  and#8221;document what the bundle names of its own kernel extensions mean.and#8221;             as ted points out this means that apple may tell us that 10.3.8 fixes a fan problem in g5s but and#8221;it doesnand#8217;t  mention that the fix apparently resides in a file called applemacrisc4pe.kext located in /system/library/extensions.  knowing this could help troubleshoot a fan problem. but apple apparently sees no value in providing this  knowledge.and#8221; i think some of this is nostalgia for the traceability of system extensions in the pre-os x days.  however for the most part itand#8217;s a good discussion of the detective work necessary in tracking down the source of any  troubleshooting problem. give it a read.andnbsp; and if anyone at apple is reading this: more documentation  please! ,1363,2,0,0, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/07/the-trouble-with-troubleshooting-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/07/the-trouble-with-troubleshooting-os-x/,,

mac n00b / switcher tip: keyboard shortcuts ,Mar 11 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, one of the hardest things to overcome when switching from pc to the  mac or when adjusting to any new operating system is learning all of the keyboard shortcuts that are *cough* at your  fingertips.andnbsp; if you are used to using windows and office for windows then on the mac side of things a good deal  of the keyboard shortcuts will be the same with the simple substitution of the command / apple key for the control /  ctrl key that you have always used in windows and the option key for the alt key.andnbsp; for example to select all in  windows you hit ctrl + a while in os x you instead hit command + a.        a lot of people hate having to recondition their hands to these new key combinations. fortunately there are  solutions for this problem. navigate to apple menuand#8212;andgt;system preferencesand#8212;andgt;keyboard and mouse and click on the  keyboard shortcuts tab.andnbsp; here you will find a list of some of the default keyboard shortcuts and you can even  add new ones to fit your own tastes although they will not always work in all programs. if you screw up all you have  to do is hit the and#8220;restore defaultsand#8221; key to put everything back to normal.        if you really want to remap your macand#8217;s keys so that they behave more like the windows machine you grew up kicking  and endlessly rebooting then you can grab a keyboard remapping program like  ucontrol to help hack away at all the keyboard shortcuts. also  if you simply would like to work in another default keyboard layout say dvorak or german simply go to system  preferencesand#8212;andgt;international and click on the input menu tab where you can activate the input menu through which you  can switch your keyboard layout. ,1734,1,0,4, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/11/mac-n00b-switcher-tip-keyboard-shortcuts/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/11/mac-n00b-switcher-tip-keyboard-shortcuts/,,

apple education store pricing ,Mar 15 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, iand#8217;ve been meaning to complain about this for a while now.andnbsp; i work in education so i get all sorts of  technology perks especially from apple who offer discounts on all their hardware and software for educators /  students through their online apple store for  education.andnbsp; this is great. thank you apple for caring about education.             however this is what annoys me: apple retail stores only offer educational discounts on the apple hardware. honestly  this is why i do not own ilife and#8216;05 yet.andnbsp; i can get the suite at a nicely reduced educational price but i have to  pay shipping and handling and wait for it. as a result i just think that iand#8217;ll wait till tiger is released and get both  tiger and ilife and#8216;05 with the purchase of a mac mini maybe.             hereand#8217;s where the apple retail stores are shooting themselves in the feet: i would have already impulse bought ilife  and#8216;05 and most likely a lot of other apple software titles to boot had the apple retail store had educational pricing  on their software as they do on the hardware.andnbsp; but as is the educational savings are too high for me to throw  caution to the wind and spend spend spend.andnbsp; what gives apple?andnbsp; why the hardware vs. software distinction in  the retail stores? ,1330,1,0,13, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/15/apple-education-store-pricing/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/15/apple-education-store-pricing/,,

general motors to provide ipod-friendly interface ,Mar 18 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii, when portable cd players first emerged on  the market there was a time period where the only way to listen in your car was either via headphones not the safest  solution or via a cassette tape adapter.andnbsp; then for a short period before every car started being manufactured  with a built-in cd player there was an interim period where several car manufacturers began including line-in jacks  so you could simply run a cable from the headphone jack of your cd player into your car stereo.andnbsp; unfortunately  most car manufacturers phased these inputs out after cd players became the default car audio unit.        general motors has announced that they are going to begin including an audio jack again so that their cars will  be ipod ready: and#8221;the new radios will include an auxiliary channel and front mounted auxiliary input jack so that an  ipod or other audio source can be easily plugged in and played through the vehicle audio system.and#8221; good but itand#8217;s  not really anything new. itand#8217;s something old that they never should have removed.

tiger tips: using dictionary lookup in non-cocoa apps ,May 9 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,os:&:features:&:tips and tricks , tigers dictionary lookup feature has been called the andquot;use-it-anywhereandquot; dictionary. sadly thats not true unless every application on your mac is a cocoa application that uses nstextview and webview which are the requirements for accessing the dictionary via contextual menu or keyboard shortcut. thats not the case on my mac. i spend a lot of my time in carbon apps most notably bbedit. to use the lookup feature in bbedit i have to make a trip to the services menu. thats pretty inconvenient for someone who likes to keep their hands on the keyboard. services can be extremely useful but if there are no keyboard shortcuts to accompany the desired service odds are good that i wont be using it.thanks to john gruber i can now use the built-in dictionary lookup feature in bbedit and a handful of other applications i spend a lot of time in without missing a beat. johns recent article reminded me that i can assign a custom keyboard shortcut to the lookup service and many other things using the keyboard shortcuts tab in the keyboard and mouse preference pane. for some reason i always forget that preference exists so im happy to be reminded of it. the only problem with this method is that it requires you to select the word you want to lookup rather than just hovering over it. i can live with that. if you cant check out the applescript in johns article which uses gui scripting in order to accomplish the same goal without having to highlight the word. ,1474,4,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/09/tiger-tips-using-dictionary-lookup-in-non-cocoa-apps/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/09/tiger-tips-using-dictionary-lookup-in-non-cocoa-apps/,,

tiger bits: possible spotlight bug ,May 11 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,os:&:software , this afternoon i decided to plug an external firewire drive into my powerbook and do a clean install of tiger onto that drive just to test the differences between running tiger off the clean install on my powerbook via the firewire drive versus off of the internal archive and install installation on the powerbooks default hard drive.      so i installed to the external drive called portahd and didnt transfer anything over from the powerbooks internal drive macintosh hd.  when it booted up off of portahd everything was looking good and clean and i saw the little video intro that i missed out on the other two times ive installed tiger.  spotlight started scanning everything including macintosh hd but i didnt want it to so i opened up the system preferences of the portahd installation and moved macintosh hd over into the privacy pane.  oddly there were the same folders that i already had in the privacy pane of my macintosh hd installation in the porta hd installation.      i didnt think anything of it until later when i rebooted to macintosh hd.  i keyed over to spotlight and typed firefox wanting to launch firefox. it didnt come up. thats when it clicked in my head.      i looked back in the spotlight preference pane and sure enough my macintosh hd was still set in the privacy pane.  so now everything is reindexing and i lost the last several days of indexing and training spotlight all because the preferences on a separate installation on a separate drive leaked over to this one.  very very odd.        update: it would appear that this is actually a spotlight feature which is explained nicely by the first two comments to this post. still i wish i had known it was a feature before i mistakenly privatized my main drive in spotlight. ,1760,0,1,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/11/tiger-bits-possible-spotlight-bug/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/11/tiger-bits-possible-spotlight-bug/,

yahoo music unlimited takes on itunes ,May 11 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,analysis / opinion:&:audio:&:ipod family:&:its , yesterday yahoo introduced the beta of their new yahoo music unlimited service a subscription-based music downloading service that costs $6.99/month or $60/year. the service is currently available only to us-based customers. yahoo takes square aim at the itunes music store 70%+ marketshare by allowing users to play tunes from a catalog of more than one million songs  transfer tracks to compatible portable devices those that support microsofts janus technology and even share music libraries through yahoo!  messenger.yahoo is betting that music lovers would rather pay a flat subscription fee to andquot;rentandquot; unlimited tracks for the term of their subscription instead of buying them outright for $.99 a song. im not so sure theyre right about that and i suspect that existing ipod owners probably wont be rushing to buy a andquot;compatible portable deviceandquot; to replace their ipod so that they can listen to the windows media files that yahoo offers on the go.some good may still come of this for apple fans. if yahoos service is even remotely popular it may cause apple to rethink its pay-per-track strategy and start offering a subscription choice for the itms.itll be interesting to see how this one plays out but i think yahoo is a little late to the party. ,1282,3,0,17, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/11/yahoo-music-unlimited-takes-on-itunes/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/11/yahoo-music-unlimited-takes-on-itunes/,,

if you like safari  youll like shiira ,May 12 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,software , since were talking about browsers today i thought you might be interested in checking out a happy little andquot;accidentandquot; called the shiira project. shiira is a web browser based on web kit and written in cocoa. the goal  of the shiira project says the author is to create a browser that is better and more  useful than safari. since shiira uses the same rendering engine used by safari pages look the same in both browsers. even better right now shiira shares your bookmark environment with safari so you can switch back and forth between both browsers while you try it out without having to worry about syncing bookmarks between the two.so basically what we have in shiira is a web browser that looks and acts pretty much like safari. so why bother? well there are a few neat tricks shiira can do that safari cant. you should check out some of the feature list screenshots when you have a minute. the coolest one is andquot;tab expose.andquot; tab expose is exactly what it sounds like... it uses expose preset to f8 by default to tile all open browser tabs instead of just browser windows. its a surprisingly handy feature that i implore apple to add to safari itself. are you listening dave hyatt? ,1211,4,0,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/12/if-you-like-safari-youll-like-shiira/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/12/if-you-like-safari-youll-like-shiira/,,

tiger tips: hate spotlight? turn it off ,May 13 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,os:&:software:&:hacks:&:how-tos , theres a very detailed terminal-intensive and imho somewhat just plain crazy and risky hack over at mac os x hints that shows you how to eradicate spotlight from tiger. however macfixit offers a simpler solution for turning off spotlight if you just dont happen to like it very much.     to do this launch your terminal located in /applications/utilities/ and type the following:       sudo pico /etc/hostconfig      this will open up your hostconfig file which tells os x what processes to launch at startup.  scroll down the hostconfig file and find the line that reads spotlight=-yes- and change it to spotlight=-no-. close and save the file. if you dont know how to use pico type man pico to read over its man pages first. if you want to remove spotlight from the menu bar remove the file search.bundle from the folder /system/library/coreservices but keep it around somewhere in case you change your mind. when you reboot the computer spotlight will not load.    if you ever want to re-enable spotlight just go back through these steps and change no back to yes and put search.bundle back where it belongs.      why would anyone want to remove spotlight?  according to macfixit we continue to cover an issue where mac os x 10.4s spotlight function consumes inordinate amounts of processor time resulting in slower overall system performance or seemingly complete systems stalls. ,1385,2,2,15, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/13/tiger-tips-hate-spotlight-turn-it-off/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/13/tiger-tips-hate-spotlight-turn-it-off/,

how to make an ipod bomb ,May 13 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample, iii,ipod family:&:tips and tricks , okay.  not really.  but heres what to avoid doing to keep your ipod or any device with a lithium-based battery for that matter from exploding: dont soak it in water.  if you do happen to soak it in water and try to see if it works immediately after removing it from water dont try to take it apart yourself to see what is broken.  its wet.  thats what is broken.  in any case a kid in australia accidently left his ipod in his dirty laundry and it ended up going through the wash he decided to take it apart and boom! the ipod popped open burning the cover and emitting some toxic fumes. the boy inhaled the fumes and was treated for breathing difficulties afterwards but is okay albeit sans an ipod.  i myself have dropped multiple cellphones in the toilet multiple times cell phone on belt clip belt clip hits toilet seat as im pulling up my pants cellphone plops into recently flushed toilet.  none of them have broken.  why? because i follow very careful steps whenever i get electronics wet.  i dry them off with a towel. i dont turn them on to see if they work as running electricity will fry the circuits.  i remove the battery if it is removable with a towel between me and the battery.  i then let it sit and dry out for a good 48 hours. and then if it was dropped in the toilet i nuke it with some anti-bacterial spray to boot.

mac digital camera update ,May 26 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,accessories:&:peripherals:&:odds and ends , thanks to everyone who weighed in with their recommendations for a good dslr camera.    i havent purchased yet but i have made my decision. once i started looking carefully at the replies in the comments to my previous post on this topic and then going to informative sites like digital photography review and steves digicams the playing field of choices quickly narrowed down to two good cameras that fit within my budget: the canon digital rebel xt 350d and the nikon d70. several of you mentioned that i shouldnt obsess over the megapixels as everything over 5 would be really good so i actually was looking at both the 8 megapixel canon 350d and the original digital rebel 300d thinking i could get the 300d for less and invest in a good macro lens.    unfortunately while all the web resources are extremely helpful at narrowing down the purchase decision to two strong contenders within my budget range they are extremely unhelpful at helping one decide between more or less equal quality cameras. if anyone from these sites happens to read this i think it would be helpful if you had some quick chart on these cameras ranking the top 3 you recommend for different types of photographic situations: top 3 studio dslrs top 3 macro dslrs top 3 sports cameras etc.continue reading after the jump to see which i chose and why. ,1330,3,0,21, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/26/mac-digital-camera-update/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/26/mac-digital-camera-update/,,

wsj on apple ipod settlement ,Jun 3 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,ipod family:&:apple financial , in case you havent heard first second and third generation ipod owners have won a settlement from a class action suite against apple over the battery life of those ipods. there are lots of little details and options but basically it all boils down to apple may owe you $50.        scott thurm writes today for the wall street journal subscription required noting that a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case estimates that the settlement may apply to as many as two million ipods sold before may 31 2004. that means the settlement which still needs to be approved by a judge could cost apple as much as $100 million. thats a huge hit to apple and as a result apple stock has been declining today. ,698,2,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/03/wsj-on-apple-ipod-settlement/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/03/wsj-on-apple-ipod-settlement/,,
video ipod via linux? ,Jun 3 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,ipod family:&:video:&:hacks , not exactly.  however some of the people over at the ipod linux project have coded a video player for the ipod.  according to their chart it is supposed to work on all ipods with the exception of the 2g ipod mini; however it also requires that you have linux installed on your ipod.  since linux doesnt yet work on the 4g ipods im not really sure how *this* project is supposed to work on them. unless of course they are about to announce 4g ipod functionality this afternoon in which case i wont be posting at all because ill be busy playing with the steve jobs doll and installing linux on my ipod.        the player will only handle 24-bit uncompressed avi files displayed at ipod-native screen resolution so this isnt really a viable option for on the go video watching but nevertheless it is a really cool proof-of-concept hack showing the possibilities of what could be.

editorial: apple on intel ,Jun 6 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,wwdc , by wwdc 2007 apple will be switching to intel.  what does this mean?    it depends on who you are.  if you are a mobile user like myself it means there will be no powerbook g5.  the next powerbook will be running on an intel chip.    in fact it most likely means that there will be no new apple hardware until there is some sort of intel-powered apple product. i cannot imagine apple managing to sell many machines running a powerpc chip after they just ditched the platform so openly and quickly. so if youve been waiting for the wwdc before buying that new mac you might have to wait quite a bit longer.    this probably also means that macworld boston *could* be the place where some new hardware running on intel will first emerge.  im guessing that well see new intel-based hardware trickle in sooner rather than later.  otherwise apples sales are going to bottom out.    jason thinks that apples next move will be to give the os away for free get everyone hooked and then start charging. this is an interesting theory as it is the same bait and switch they pulled with ilife and itools become .mac.    i dont think it will happen though.  i could be totally wrong.andnbsp; i was about todays news.i could see apple now selling the os to any machine.  steve said andquot;the soul of a mac is its operating systemandquot;. if thats true then what is to stop a marketing movement called andquot;make your pc a mac: give it some soul.andquot;    it also means that that soul will most likely be shackled by drm.... dont get me started.        these are just some random thoughts i am having as i reel in shock at this news. what do you think? ,1646,1,0,43, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/06/editorial-apple-on-intel/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/06/editorial-apple-on-intel/,,

karelia software previews sandvox ,Jun 7 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,software:&:internet tools , many of you may remember and indeed still use as i do a great application from karelia software called watson. originally released in 2001 watson was a andquot;web servicesandquot; application allowing you to view info from the web without having to use a browser via a series of andquot;services.andquot; ebay auctions package tracking local weather and television schedules monetary exchange rates and more were available. i loved it and registered it just a day after trying it out. like i said i still use it.when apple released mac os 10.2 andquot;jaguarandquot; in august of 2002 it included a revamped version of sherlock which looked and behaved a lot like watson. to make a long story and old argument short watson was licensed by sun microsystems in 2004 and karelia has since stopped supporting the application. i only mention this story because watson is such a pleasure to use i was thrilled to see that the boys at karelia have a new project up on the work bench.previewed at wwdc this week sandvox is a wysiwyg web development tool that promises to combine incredible ease of use with an intuitive interface and beautiful professionally designed templates. features youd expect are in place like drag-and-drop assembly and rich text editing along with some geekier goodies like automatic rss generation the option to code by hand and an extensible plug-in architecture. sounds interesting to me and karelia is currently looking for eager beta testers to give them a hand when the time rolls around.andnbsp; i signed up and if i end up loving sandvox half as much as i love watson this will be one sweet little app. ,1631,4,0,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/07/karelia-software-previews-sandvox/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/07/karelia-software-previews-sandvox/,,

mac x86 bios? ,Jun 7 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,analysis / opinion:&:hardware:&:os , if you havent seen them yet apple has officially released the universal binary programming guidelines. there are some interesting tidbits in here.andnbsp; most striking perhaps is that theres no mention of programming for 64-bit intel chips; the usage ia-32 is applied universally.andnbsp; were still early in the process though and if the intel chips really are going to hit the consumer products first theres plenty of time for 64-bit integration.andnbsp; more interesting to me is that the x86 transition will seemingly be a shift away from an open source base.andnbsp; the core os itself will seemingly continute to be darwin but the machines will apparently go back to booting a proprietary bios:macintosh computers using intel microprocessors do not use open firmware. although many parts of the io registry are present and work as expected information that is provided by open firmware on a macintosh using a powerpc microprocessor such as a complete device tree is not available in the io registry on a macintosh using an intel microprocessor. you can obtain some of the information from iodevicetree by using the sysctlbyname or sysctl commands.  no word on what the bios will be but i think we can expect one of the standard pc options. ,1248,1,0,13, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/07/mac-x86-bios/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/07/mac-x86-bios/,,

will the mac finder be phased out? ,Jun 9 2005 12:00AM,dave caolo,analysis / opinion:&:os , california design firm frog design wonders about the fate of the macintosh finder in light of mac os 10.4 tigers system wide spotlight search. basically their argument is that spotlights far-reaching search capabilities combined with the inclusion of smart folders in tigers finder make the practice of navigating through a nested hierarchy of folders seem inelegant and unnecessary. i dont think id go so far as to say that the nested folder metaphor of the current mac os finder is on its way out but i have found that spotlight and smart folders have changed the way i use my mac.andnbsp; ive started to rely on spotlight more and more heavily both for finding items i may have lost as well as items i could locate in an instant. for example i have a number of garageband loops on my imac that ive downloaded from a number of sources. they all live in a folder called andquot;loopsandquot; within my home directorys music folder. recently i wanted to use a particular one. i didnt know exactly where in the loops folder it was but i knew it had andquot;tunnelandquot; in its title. a quick spotlight search brought it up without my having to leave garageband. later i wanted to hear a certain song in itunes and instead of launching itunes and navigating to that song i simply searched its title in spotlight and started it up in an instant. thats when i realized the real logic behind spotlight. ,1401,1,0,13, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/09/will-the-mac-finder-be-phased-out/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/09/will-the-mac-finder-be-phased-out/,,

on buying the new foo fighters album from the itms ,Jun 14 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,analysis / opinion:&:its:&:itunes , so this morning as i was doing my daily morning routineandmdash;500 push-ups 1000 crunches a 30-minute jog around my apartment...you know the usualandmdash;anyway as i was doing all this i decided to go grab the new foo fighters album from the itms as it was released today and i am a huge fan of the foo.    why do i mention this here on tuaw? well i have two reasons: the first typical of me is a complaint. i purchased started the download and then continued with the aforementioned daily morning routine. when i was ready to jet out the door i ran over to my powerbook to shut her up and go only to discover that only half of the double-album had been downloaded because the itms had decided to launch a little dialog window thanking me for purchasing this album. thanks but no thanks. this dialog stopped the download and made me late heading out the door. sure i could have just shut everything up and gone but i didnt want to risk mangling any of the tracks or itunes saying andquot;you have already downloaded all purchased music.andquot; i wouldnt mind the dialog if it didnt interrupt the download but as is it is a supreme pain. dear apple please fix this.  thank you.    item number 2: i think this is the first album from the itms that i have seen let alone purchased that came with both a digital booklet and a bonus interview video with the band.  super-cool value-added to the online purchase.  i wonder if the actual cd set contains this bonus video. in any case i wanted to note that i like this growth in the itms. i think it is value-added and makes me hate them just a little bit less for all their drm nastiness although i still hate them.    now if youll excuse me i need to burn this double-album to cd and then re-rip it so i can put it on my lifedrive and my psp. ,1791,0,0,22, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/14/on-buying-the-new-foo-fighters-album-from-the-itms/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/14/on-buying-the-new-foo-fighters-album-from-the-itms/,,

itunes per ipod ,Jun 15 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,apple corporate:&:ipod family:&:its , the folks over at downhill battle have taken a close look at what apples press releases say about the itunes music store and the ipod after the itms one year anniversary. the results are interesting. despite the overwhelming success of the itms a very small percentage of the content on ipods is downloaded through itms. so what are people doing with the rest of their space? no one knows. the authors seem to assume that all ipods are loaded up with music from other sources. no doubt thats where the majority of the space is going: music ripped from cds and some music downloaded from other sources. they seem to ignore however the ipods ability to download large audio books from audible and other sources the ipod photos goal of storing pictures and the ipods general utility as a firewire/usb 2.0 drive among other uses. i can think of a lot of things to do with all that space.update: for those of you who want the most up-to-date stats the most recent number put the ratio between 25-1 and 40-1 depending on whether you like your stats official or unofficial. its still a drop in the bucket and puts the real effect of the itms on music consumption in perspective.[via boing boing] ,1190,3,0,18, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/15/itunes-per-ipod/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/15/itunes-per-ipod/,,

adjab on the possibility of apples with intel on the outside ,Jun 15 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,analysis / opinion:&:apple corporate , tom biro of adjab fame asked the tuaw team over the past week what we thought about the possibility of intel branding on the new apple intel-chip-based computers and every one of us had an answer. tom has posted a detailed feature over at adjab with some key selections from our different responses.        heres toms intro to the post: after the recent announcement that apple would begin to incorporate intel chips into their computers over the next few years and the subsequent freakout and calm-down i still only have one question - will those little intel inside decals make their way onto the outside of apples historically clean boxes? the intel inside program is not mandatory and merely acts as a co-op marketing opportunity for boxmakers to leverage the intel brand while sharing the cost of advertising when the intel name is used. however just as many pc owners had no clue what kind of processor they were using in their machines for years and years there are probably many an apple user who have the same issue - except the hardcore apple folks of course.      head on over to the full post to see what laurie scott dave jay and i had to say on the topic along with toms observations on our disparate thoughts and his own take on the situation. make sure you weigh in with your own thoughts in the comments over at adjab.        thanks tom! ,1356,2,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/15/adjab-on-the-possibility-of-apples-with-intel-on-the-outside/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/15/adjab-on-the-possibility-of-apples-with-intel-on-the-outside/,,

how to make screencasts on the mac ,Jun 16 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,how-tos:&:education , tom hoffman over at ed-tech insider has posted an interesting discussion of creating instructional screencasts on the mac and delivering them as pdfs. hoffman notes: instead of creating a fully animated screencast i created a sequence of annotated screenshots. the key is to take lots of screenshots so every step is captured. even so this method works best with web applications where your interaction with the program is dictated by clicking on links to load new pages rather than more dynamic actions you use in a desktop app like dragging and dropping and pulling down menus.        in order to take the numerous screenshots he needed hoffman used automator to create a script that takes a screenshot and moves the resulting picture file into iphoto. after he finished grabbing the screenshots he needed he then imported the iphoto pictures into keynote organized them and added visual elements and then exported to pdf.  this is cool but i would have opened imovie imported all the screenshots from the iphoto library then put them in sequence in the timeline animating them and then add a voice-over. after i was done id simply export to mpeg-4 for easy screencasting to the web.        ill work on a workflow for doing this and if it works out nicely i might start including a few screencasts with some of our how-tos here at tuaw. ,1340,1,0,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/16/how-to-make-screencasts-on-the-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/16/how-to-make-screencasts-on-the-mac/,,

dell would sell os x ,Jun 16 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,analysis / opinion:&:os:&:steve jobs , david kirkpatrick reporting for fortune notes that in email correspondence michael dell said if apple decides to open the mac os to others we would be happy to offer it to our customers.      although neither apple nor steve jobs have indicated that they have any interest in opening os x up to non-apple-branded hardware this admission by dell is a rather huge boon for apple. up until this point no large player in the pc world has gone on record saying that they would run os x on their boxes if apple opened up the platform. considering that dell is such a large player in the personal computing arena if steve jobs were to decide to allow for this most likely other pc manufacturers would follow suit and there *could* be a chance of apple challenging the microsoft-dominated world of personal pcs.        then again if apple were to do this it would be a rather huge gamble and running os x on multiple slightly different pieces of hardware would entail a lot of driver compatibility which in my opinion is one of the many difficulties and weak spots with windows xp. os x running on more varied systems means more software support for drivers for different pc devices and could quite quickly become a big point of instability in what until now has remained a rather tightly reigned and controlled operating system.        what do you think? should steve and michael sit down and have a talk? ,1400,0,8,32, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/16/dell-would-sell-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/16/dell-would-sell-os-x/,,

little snitch updated ,Jun 17 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,software:&:internet tools , little snitch came out with an update today. this little handy app blows the whistle on any outgoing traffic from your mac to the internet. heres how it works: andquot;contrary to incoming connections which usually go to a fixed port outgoing connections come from random port numbers. this makes it very hard to filter them in an ordinary firewall. this is where little snitch fills the gap: it allows you to filter connections based on the application which attempts the connection. and to make it even more handy little snitch can build the rule set interactively: it pops up a dialog when an application tries to connect and asks you what to do.andquot; you can check it out in demo mode and if you like it it will run you $24.95.    however if youre not fond of windows popping up warning you of connections all the time and youd rather simply monitor the activities on your network you might want to check out net monitor for os x which runs $8 per single user license.    of course if you dont like spending money and you are simply looking to run a ping a traceroute or some other basic networking bit theres always the network utility located in /applications/utilities/ that comes with os x.  check it out. ,1218,2,0,2, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/17/little-snitch-updated/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/17/little-snitch-updated/,,

apple dropping virex support on .mac ,Jun 20 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,apple corporate:&:ilife:&:features:&:internet:&:internet tools , if youve been by www.mac.com lately you may have noticed that all the virex links are gone. macfixit today is reporting that apple has in fact decided to drop virex support because of ongoing tiger compatibility issues; current panther users can download updated virus defs through the end of the month. this is extremely unfortunate for a number of reasons. first of all virex through .mac was a steal: a .mac subscription was less than half the cost of a stand-alone macafee 5 seat license the cheapest license they offer. more importantly making virus protection easily available benefits everyone not just the people who have it installed by slowing down the spread of viruses.theres no word yet on what if anything will replace virex in the .mac stable but i certainly hope something does and quickly. for apples sake i hope they find something to add value to the service because its going to be hard to justify the price for a glorified webdav server since they dont offer connectivity and most people have web an email services through their isps. its also irresponsible i think to offer on-line data services high volume email and folder sharing without offering virus protection. if nothing else i hope the put up some decent how-to article for free alternatives. ,1275,2,3,26, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/20/apple-dropping-virex-support-on-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/20/apple-dropping-virex-support-on-mac/,,

maintainability: lessons apple could stand to relearn ,Jun 21 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,analysis / opinion:&:desktops:&:hardware:&:emac , if youve been wondering why i havent had many bylines in the past couple of days come on you know you have its because my trusty emac died and ive been struggling with repairs. and i do mean struggling. replacing the clicking hard drive which should be a simple enough repair has turned into an hours long comedy of errors. i love this computer. i love its shiny no chrome body. i love its imac-meets-rocketship-nose-cone good looks. above all i love its crt: flat panels dont really work for me or my eyes. but i dont think ill ever own another even if the line is converted to intel. heres why.on this model apple got carried away and forgot they were making a computer and that computers break. the screws which give it just that right touch of industrial design are almost an inch across but the hex sockets are narrow and shallow making them prone to stripping. and stripping them is exactly what the service people did when i had it in for a recalled video board. i had to drill two of them out not a pleasant prospect on a machine that is essentially a thin shell over a bare crt.once you get inside things get worse. with the power button around the side instead of in front just taking the case off means stretching the delicate wires to the power button to their limit and then unplugging them one-handed while you hold the case in the air with your other hand. and getting to the hard drive easily the most frequent point of failure requires discharging the crt and disassembling almost the entire machine to get at a unit that is locked away sideways under the andquot;digital board.andquot;the thing is it didnt used to be like this. apple engineers used to put effort into making case designs functional as well as good looking whether it was the pluggable performa chassis that anticipated modern blade servers or hinged power supply mounting brackets of the quadra and early powermac cases that nearly doubled the effective working room or the fold-out sides on the bondi g3s. of course i cant speak for the original imac and i know that space is tight in the andquot;nose coneandquot; shell but there has to be a better way. ,2143,0,0,8, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/21/maintainability-lessons-apple-could-stand-to-relearn/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/21/maintainability-lessons-apple-could-stand-to-relearn/,,

privacy watch: tor ,Jun 22 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,software:&:cool tools:&:internet:&:internet tools:&:open source , with the nonsense on capitol hill this week and discussion of dmca revision and funding ramping up i thought it would be a good time to talk about tor the award-winning privacy protocol and software from the eff. unlike other anonymizers that work by encrypting  or proxying particular services and protocols tors tls-over-onion routing scheme works by re-routing all tcp traffic through a complex network of tor nodes. packets including routing information are encrypted between each node and each node has access to only very limited information about the next hop. furthermore packets pass through a random number of nodes the more the merrier and not all packets from a single session need follow the same route. this makes it very very difficult its tempting to say impossible but thats probably not quite true to trace the ultimate origin or destination of any packet on the network unless the contents of the packet divulge revealing information.there are drawbacks of course. although the onion routing algorithms are good onion routing certainly has the potential for higher latency that traditional rip and ospf routing. tor is also not an end-to-end solution. if the ultimate destination of a packet is a machine that doesnt support tor the packet is in the open from the time it leaves the tor exit point and using traditional end-to-end encrytption on top of tor is advisable.the gains are significant though and as the protocol becomes more widely adopted the advantages will become even more pronounced. aside from privacy protection tors andquot;next hopandquot; tls encryption virtually eliminates the potential for traditional andquot;man in the middleandquot; attacks within the network because such attacks rely on knowing the origin and destination of packets and capturing a usable data stream. tor particularly if combined with end-to-end encryption also makes encrypted data less susceptible to brute force attacks; it is much more difficult to capture a complete data stream and data is encrypted multiple times with short-lived session keys.even though tor is still in beta its well worth a download the windows version already won a pcworld andquot;best products of 2005 securityandquot; award. take a look and if you have a public ip think about setting up a server. ,2296,4,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/22/privacy-watch-tor/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/22/privacy-watch-tor/,,

dcraw-x: raw done right ,Jun 23 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,ilife:&:software:&:tips and tricks:&:odds and ends:&:open source:&:unix / bsd , as a followup to c.k.s complaints about apples raw image handling i thought id take a look at effective raw handling under os x. dcraw-x is bryan changs os x cocoa wrapper for dave coffins dcraw program. it performs transformations on raw files and outputs them in psd format ready for photoshop or other psd-capable software manipulation. dcraw is the industry standard its probably lurking under iphoto somewhere too and reads almost all raw formats. it also allows for extensive modification of the original raw data including custom color profiling.of course this still doesnt solve all the complaints about os x raw handling: you still wont be directly manipulating the raw file. this strikes me as a good thing though. the raw files are the negatives of the digital world. you want to keep them somewhere safe and untouched in case you want them later. performing manipulations on a raw output stream is a different matter though and pre-processing with dcraw-x is head and shoulders above iphotos jpeg manipulations even if you end up putting the final image into iphoto later.if the $15 shareware is too steep for you the dcraw engine is open source. you can pick up the source from daves site and compile the command line tool yourself. ,1247,3,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/23/dcraw-x-raw-done-right/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/23/dcraw-x-raw-done-right/,,

end of the day itunes podcast review ,Jun 28 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,analysis / opinion:&:its:&:software:&:blogging:&:itunes:&:open source , now that weve all had some time to get cozy with itunes+podcasting its time to look at whats really going on here. i really like the idea of incorporating podcasting support directly into itunes. its a neat feature to have so many casts all in one place and to be able to subscribe to the directly from within itunes; this really streamlines my audio management. my eyes and my ears are very very happy.my heart is a little bit more foreboding. itunes 4.9 doesnt support the increasingly popular bit torrent casts. we can hope this functionality comes along later but if it doesnt a lot of little guys are going to get forced out. commercial sites will be unaffected but people paying monthly badwidth fees out of pocket arent going to be able to handly the kind of traffic the itms is capable of delivering. of course no one has to opt into the itms in the first place but the setup is shall we say somewhat less than egalitarian. more troubling as kevin tofel over at droxy pointed out is the fact that people who dont do podcasting according to apples podcasting specification sheet* are cut out of the itms. ,1113,2,0,11, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/28/end-of-the-day-itunes-podcast-review/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/28/end-of-the-day-itunes-podcast-review/,,

itunes rss extensions ,Jun 29 2005 12:00AM,scott mcnulty,its:&:itunes , rss is the fuel in the engine of the blogosphere and it is alsoandnbsp; the reason that podcasts have caught on so quickly. itunes 4.9 has built in support for podcasts as we all know however apple had to extend the rss standard which is allowed in order to get some itunes specific information about the various podcasts stored in the directory like duration if the content is explicit and so on.edd dumbill has reviewed apples rss extensions and has found it to be a mixed bag. he hopes that apple will move to a more inclusive model and take some friendly criticism to heart and make a few changes.i have a feeling that apple wants to dominate the podcasting space and i will post more about this later so i am not too sure if they will change their specs but it would be good for the common podcaster.[via scripting news] ,827,4,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/29/itunes-rss-extensions/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/29/itunes-rss-extensions/,,

ipod linux: 2g mini ,Jun 30 2005 12:00AM,jay savage,ipod family:&:hacks:&:open source , some interesting news from the ipod linux project this week: more complete 2g mini support. the 2g is now in line with the with the 1g mini 4g ipods. in other words it functions as a linux-based pad but wont do much more. if you want to read your mail on an ipod you still need a 1g 2g or 3g for ip over firewire support. still it means a usable ipod for those who are interested. the really interesting news though is that the 2g mini runs faster than other available ipods averaging 37 bogomips to the 4g ipods 32. apparently the 5022 processor in the new ipods really is significantly more efficient than the 5020 in existing products despite running at the same clock speed and being register-compatible with the 5020. no word yet on how the new models released this week will perform but if theyre using the 5022 they should run the 4g builds unmodified but faster.via make ,880,3,0,3, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/30/ipod-linux-2g-mini/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/06/30/ipod-linux-2g-mini/,,

tunewears new tuneclip cable tamer ,Jul 5 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,accessories:&:ipod family , i am constantly detangling the earphone wires attached to my ipods. i must not be the only one because there are at least a handful of accessories on the market that do nothing other than prevent such things from happening. the latest in that category is the tuneclip cable winder from tunewear.the tuneclip is a clear plastic disc-shaped cable winder. it has a spring clip on the back for easy attaching to your clothing belt loop backpack strap etc... and a removable ball-bearing style chain so you can carry it on your key ring. it features cable stoppers that keep your cords from unwinding and getting in the way when you least want them to and it weighs only 5 grams so it wont weigh you down.the tuneclip is handy for more than just earphone cables though... you can also use it to wind and manage unruly mouse cables and the like. for $10 i think i think youll get you moneys worth of practical uses.[via ipodlounge] ,927,2,0,1, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/05/tunewears-new-tuneclip-cable-tamer/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/05/tunewears-new-tuneclip-cable-tamer/,,

macfixit on filling the norton utilities gap ,Jul 11 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,analysis / opinion:&:software , ted landua of macfixit fame has posted this months editorial on filling the norton utilities gap. my original response to only reading the title of landaus article was: andquot;theres a gap?andquot; in the first paragraph landau points out how os x makes any maintenance beyond the tools included with the os like disk utility rather unnecessary but continues on anyway noting: andquot;even so it pays to be prepared. thats why i would still recommend having at least one repair utility beyond first aid in your troubleshooting arsenal.andquot;    looking for a replacement for the now defunct mac version of norton utilities landau points to drive genius. according to the drive genius product page the software is andquot;packed with powerful tools such as a drive optimizer a comprehensive repair facility for analyzing repairing and rebuilding volumes plus excellent testing capabilities with media surface scanning performance benchmarking and data integrity checking.... drive genius features advanced tools for resizing and moving of volumes without reformatting and sports a sector editing tool to modify the data on any sector of the drive -- powerful features that will satisfy even the seasoned mac experts.andquot; sounds cool and there is a demo available in case you want to give the program a test run before dropping $99 usd for a single-user license.       my take: save yourself the $99 use the free utilities built into os x and just backup your data on a regular basis.  when everything goes south it inevitably always does reformat / replace drive and restore. ,1583,2,0,6, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/11/macfixit-on-filling-the-norton-utilities-gap/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/11/macfixit-on-filling-the-norton-utilities-gap/,,

did apple change the signal strength scale with airport 4.2? ,Jul 14 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,software:&:airport:&:software update , since i am in a hotel room with a reliable but fluctuating wifi signal i cant verify this but avi flax wrote in with the following:andquot;i just installed the just-released airport software 4.2 update and after rebooting i noticed that apple seems to have changed the scale that the airport icon uses to display signal strength. before reboot the icon was consistently at 2-3 bars. afterwards its steady on 4 which should indicate a 100% signal which made me a bit dubious. i doubted that the software update would have improved signal that much. so i launched the always-handy apgrapher and verified that the signal strength hadnt changed at all and was still around 40-45% - a far cry from the 100% that the airport icon now implies.    this doesnt actually bother me or anything i just think its worth noting. it reminds me of automakers removing oil pressure gages from car dashboards because of people worrying about their oil pressure or making engine temp gages stay in the middle except in the case of emergencies. these changes were only made possible by engines becoming much more reliable so wireless technology may one day be able to eliminate signal gages in the same vein.andquot;can anyone else confirm this behavior? ,1235,2,0,24, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/14/did-apple-change-the-signal-strength-scale-with-airport-4-2/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/14/did-apple-change-the-signal-strength-scale-with-airport-4-2/,,

wired news calls macworld andquot;small and sad andquot; but finds a cool product outside the show ,Jul 15 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,macworld:&:accessories:&:analysis / opinion:&:peripherals:&:portables:&:powerbook , mark baard of wired news shares the sentiment professed by many others. he goes so far as to say andquot;this years boston event at the hynes convention center felt a bit  small and sad. a few hundred attendees shuffled about the show floor  wednesday accompanied by local tv news reporters and folks from the  mac trade pubs.  andquot; unlike me however baard got more out of idg spokesman mike sponseller than a creepy threat. he got numbers. sponseller told baard the show is seeing more exhibitors and attendees  than last year. sponseller said he hoped for about 8000  visitors by the end of the week. compare that with the roughly 35000 attendees who were in san francisco this past january and the estimated 40000 that braved new york in 2003 before the show moved back to boston. in 2001 the new york numbers were more than 64000!all was not lost however. baard found a guy outside the hynes doing his own guerilla marketing for his product the surface laptop stand which looks as good if not better than most of what i saw inside the exhibit hall. bo eriksson the designer of the surface built it in his basement and said he only came to boston because he lives in new york just a few hours away. eriksson is exactly the kind of exhibitor idg should be catering to. im not saying that the big guys the quarks and lacies of the world who also have a place there should be banished but more representation of the little guy - in mass quantity - would make for a better show in my book. in an effort to put my money where my mouth is i think im going to buy one of those surface stands now. : ,1600,2,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/15/wired-news-calls-macworld-small-and-sad/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/15/wired-news-calls-macworld-small-and-sad/,,

.mac bandwidth cap ,Jul 20 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,analysis / opinion:&:internet:&:internet tools , as a .mac user my initial thoughts on seeing that apple had decided to implement a cap on previously uncapped .mac bandwidth centered around one question: is this going to make the service better or worse?         macworld is spinning the story as .mac offering a higher-bandwidth option as a 3gb cap is being placed on regular .mac users but people like myself who have purchased a full gb of .mac space will get an expanded premium cap of 10gbs of bandwidth. not too shabby.        macmerc on the other hand posts an entry on this switch entitled bandwidth of .mac accounts limited to 3gb per month. this is an entirely different spin than the macworld story as it points out that a cap is being put on in the first place where there was none before although in the past apple has been known to contact .mac users when their bandwidth has reached ludicrous speed*.        since im reaping the benefit of having the slightly muscled out 1gb .mac account with 10gbs of bandwidth im not really sure which spin i should be taking on the topic; so im opting to take a wait-and-see based on my original thoughts. what if the reason that the .mac service has been so spotty has been the lack of any sort of cap? there are some days when my idisk is the slow beast that grinds my mac to a halt and others where it performs fair to middling. what if capping people who have been abusing the service suddenly improves the service for everyone involved? if the performance remains shaky however then ill most likely see this as apple yet again taking away something that had previously been free and repackaging it behind nice buzzwords like high-bandwidth option. time will tell i guess.      *note: i realize that bandwidth is not equal to speed. its a joke. ,1753,3,0,7, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/20/mac-bandwidth-cap/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/20/mac-bandwidth-cap/,,

how do you rip a clip from a dvd on os x? ,Jul 22 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,video:&:how-tos:&:surveys and polls , anders pollas wants to know about os x dvd-ripping software. there are several tools out there that will rip an entire dvd to your hard drive either compressed or uncompressed but none of these tools make grabbing a specific clip from a film easy which is what anders needs. he says andquot;im looking for some way of grabbing a specific 3-minute part of a dvd drag it into imovie or something along those lines for trimming the bits do a decent fade or whatever.andquot;    i covered how to copy your dvds / cds in three parts one two and three a while back. however since the interest is in grabbing only a specific part of a film id use dvdbackup. this program will make an uncompressed copy of your dvd on your hard drive in a video_ts folder. after all the different .vob files have been pulled onto your computer you just need to figure out which one of those files contains the clip you want to view. if quicktime is giving you any trouble opening the .vob files try using vlc. open each file up in sequence and see if it is near where your clip appears in the dvd. once you think you have the right .vob file youll need to convert it into a file format that will let you edit it and this will be the time consuming part of the process.  quicktime tends to choke on these files and lose the audio when it converts them so youll need to grab something like handbrake dvdibbler or ffmpegx to compress and convert the file. of course all of these programs could rip and compress the entire dvd but compressing and re-encoding an entire dvd is much more time consuming 4-10 hours depending upon your processor than compressing and re-encoding the individual .vob file thus the dvdbackup step above. then youll most likely need quicktime pro to edit it nicely and cut out the little 3-minute clip. this method is lots and lots of work and very time consuming.     does anyone know of a simpler and quicker solution? let us know in the comments.update: make sure you check the comments on this one. lots of great tips. our readers rock! ,2039,9,2,36, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/22/how-do-you-rip-a-clip-from-a-dvd-on-os-x/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/22/how-do-you-rip-a-clip-from-a-dvd-on-os-x/,,

john gruber obsessed with weather widget ,Jul 23 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,analysis / opinion:&:software , its official. john gruber of daring fireball fame is completely and utterly obsessed with dashboards weather widget. not that long ago he was posting lengthy discussions of how to hack the weather widget so that you could force it to refresh and eradicate all doubt that you may possibly be looking at an out-dated weather report.        this time around the widget hes got his eye firmly planted on some bad ui design. turns out that a lot of people are getting the wrong citys weather because they type in something like london and click the done button and get london wyomings* weather rather than london englands weather. why? because they are supposed to hit return first which pulls up a list of londons to choose from. gruber goes on to complain: needless to say the confusion here is caused by a decidedly poor ui design. the weather widget provides absolutely no indication that you need to hit return after typing your city name. and considering how mouse-oriented the entire dashboard ui is its no surprise that many people assume they just need to click the done button after typing their city name. and the done button has to be clicked  which means input validation has to be invoked by the keyboard but dismissing the configuration panel with the done button has to be done with the mouse. the right way to do something should be the obvious way. amen.        hopefully since apple is now hiring good people like mike matas ui design nightmares like those that plague the weather widget driving normally astute pundits like gruber to obsess over them will soon be a thing of the past.        *note: i dont know if this is an actual place. i made it up for the example for this post. ,1699,3,0,9, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/23/john-gruber-obsessed-with-weather-widget/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/23/john-gruber-obsessed-with-weather-widget/,,

what can i delete from my brand-spanking new mac? ,Jul 31 2005 12:00AM,c.k. sample,software:&:tips and tricks:&:surveys and polls , someone recently commented the following on a very old post: i dont know if anyone is still reading this thread but if so...i just bought my first mac. its a mini. i went with the 40gb drive because i have external drive with 200g for video editing. i like to keep that drive devoted to video files. unfortunately it seems apple has given me 20g of stuff on my drive already. after my 9.5g music collection im left with 10g to work with. my question is what can i delete from my brand-spanking new mac?        my brief advice: basically you can remove anything inside the applications folder [update: anything that is non-system software that is; dont erase quicktime or a good deal of the bits in the utilities folder; thanks to the commenter who pointed out my oversight] with little fear of bad mojo coming your way. you can also remove any extra files the system may have stashed in your documents music movies or pictures folders. everything else is a bit risky unless you are very careful. if you never use classic you can uninstall it and everything in the corresponding classic apps folder. you could also wipe the drive clean then reinstall the os choosing custom and avoid any foreign language support modules or printer drivers that you wont need. you could also do what i do and keep all of your music on your ipod while convincing itunes that those files are all local to your library. if you choose this method make sure you keep external backups of all your tunes.        what does everyone else think? is there any other way to free up as much space as possible on your internal hard drive? ,1608,3,0,25, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/31/what-can-i-delete-from-my-brand-spanking-new-mac/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/31/what-can-i-delete-from-my-brand-spanking-new-mac/,,

ikeytypepro lcd-based multi-language keyboard ,Aug 2 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,accessories:&:peripherals , remember just a few short weeks ago when the optimus keyboard was all the rage? bruce grant had let us know then that while the optimus was just a concept his company ikeyinfinity had a fully working product about to go into production. naturally this caught my attention so i emailed bruce to find out more.i had initially questioned bruce about the name of the keyboard as he said in his comment that it was to be called the ikeypro. but macally has a keyboard called ikey ikeypro in japan which would surely cause a problem down the line. he responded that when they started this project they chose ikeypro because no one else was using the name at that time. now that the product is closer to release they have changed the name to ikeytypepro with another product called ikeygrafpro in the pipeline.why all the fuss about a keyboard you ask? heres why: each key has a display to show characters according to the  specifically selected keyboard map. when a layout map is changed the  images displayed on each of the keys also change according to the new  map layout thus allowing the user to see all the desired  characters/symbols during data input. if youre having trouble visualizing that have a look at the short quicktime demo [640x480 cable/dslandnbsp; | 320x240 dialup] and read more after the jump... ,1313,7,0,10, http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/02/ikeytypepro-lcd-based-multi-language-keyboard/#comments ,http://www.tuaw.com/2005/08/02/ikeytypepro-lcd-based-multi-language-keyboard/,,

dmb encourages windows users to bypass the drm ,Aug 17 2005 12:00AM,laurie a. duncan,analysis / opinion:&:audio:&:ipod family:&:multimedia:&:itunes ," for once its mac users who are free to pop a shiny new cd into their computers without fear of it bringing down the entire system or becoming stuck in the optical drive. windows users however are getting the shaft this time if they want to copy the dave matthews band andquot;stand upandquot; cd to their itunes music library and onto their ipod due to the discs copy protection which effectively locks it into windows media player 9.0 and higher.dont fret though. dmb has posted a few tips to help pc users circumvent the restrictions. its simple really... you just have to agree to an alternate end user license agreement and burn a cd of the tracks from within windows media player. once you have this duplicate cd you can rip the tracks from that cd into itunes much like mac users often do to circumvent protected aac restrictions.dmb stresses that they think apple is really to blame for this inconvenience since itunes and the ipod arent compatible with wma or protected cds. they say andquot;please note an easier and more acceptable solution requires cooperation from apple who we have already reached out      			to in hopes of addressing this issue. to help speed this effort we ask that you use the following link to contact      			apple and ask them to provide a solution that would easily allow you to move content from protected cds into itunes or      			onto your ipod rather than having to go through the additional steps above.      			http://www.apple.com/feedback/ipod.html.andquot;im not as anti-drm as c.k. is but ill stick to blaming the record companies and the artists although mostly the record companies i think for restricting their cds to begin with. if ive bought a physical cd i should have the right to play it in whatever format suits me without jumping through hoops to do so.
